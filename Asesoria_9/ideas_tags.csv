"Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief? *Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now, but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

"The school system is specifically made to be a slaughterhouse for retards like me might as well kill myself. Listen I have no fucking option anymore, school literally only let's the selfish fucks succeed. If you're not the most safe kind of different they can handle they'll fuck you over, lie to you, abuse their power, and fuck. you. over. All the while they'll blow smoke up your ass about how much they want you to ""succeed."" 

I'm not ""succeeding"" I'm going to hell. Always telling me I'm a ""smart kid"" how stupid do you think I am? Honestly think I believe a word your two-tounged lying ass says? 

The school doesn't ""care about you"" the school doesn't want you to succeed, the school wants you to fall out the door on graduation and die in the streets so your kind can be known as the ""bad people.""

Yeah so I might just hang myself in a bathroom or something. If I had a gun I'd just shoot myself in his office, just myself obviously. I'm thinking I'll probably just cut myself in the bathrooms for now dude I'm sick living such a shitty life I could've done so much more but clearly my blood is my only voice around here. FUCK YOU WORLD!",0
"It doesn’t get better. If you say that, I hate you. 28 years I’ve been stuck on this miserable pile of shit. Blown thousands of dollars talking to idiot assholes who just waterboard me with metaphors about how beautiful life is, and it’s beautiful to these fuckers because THEY ARENT ME! Everything Ive tried brings no relief at all to this goddamn curse. I told my therapist to fuck off and flushed my pills down the toilet because I’m fucking done with everything. And if you say it gets better, you can go fuck yourself with a railroad spike covered in acid because you don’t even know if that’s true. So fuck you and everyone else who thinks it helps.",0
"I'm so depressed that my reasons for suicide are becoming more logical instead of irrational. It's like I keep coming up with reasons that it's more logical to kill myself than stay alive. 

1. Why be an emotionless husk when I could potentially reincarnate into a happier life?

2. My circumstances are the reasons for my depression, but there are only so many externally forces you can actually control.

3. If the afterlife and god exists, that makes my life pointless because I'm just going to reincarnate into some worthless fag in the next round. And I hate people who AREN'T me.

4. If there is no god or afterlife, then I'm embarrassed that I'm this shit-slinging ape-type life form instead  of something with enhanced intelligence and invulnerability.

5. I cannot use fiction as an escape anymore because it makes me feel like those worlds are real and I could go to them if I offed myself.

6. People who circlejerk how beautiful life is, funnily enough, make me want to kill myself even more because of its absurdity. They don't actually believe that, they're just under the influence of simple caffeine.

7. If the all loving source is real and it feels better than being alive...well idk guys. I thought spirituality was suppose to make me want to live, not convince me to go. 

In short, human beings cannot make up their minds and I'm embarrassed to play along with you.

"can I die if I overdose on pain meds? I don't know if this belongs here, but I need some advice. tomorrow for my seventeenth birthday I plan to overdose. my life is terrible I hate everything I hate myself I have mental issues, I struggle with self-harm and suicidal thoughts every day. I can no longer function normally. I've already tried to kill myself three times by overdosing on painkillers, placebo, neurol and so on. I've never had anything worse than nausea. I'm planning this attempt for a few weeks, a month ago I bought 2 packs of paralen and 1 single pack of ibalgin.  if I took everything (about 70 tablets) and drank alcohol, could I really die? I know about the side effects and possible health problems with the liver and kidneys etc., I honestly don't care. I know there is a small chance  of dying, but I know cases where it happened and they took less medicine. I took the most 20 paralens and I didn't feel bad. please refrain from bullshit, don't say I shouldn't do it, that I should wait for better times, etc. I really can't anymore and I don't have the courage to commit suicide in a more extreme way.",0

I KEEP GETTING FUCKED OVER BY MENTAL HEALTHCARE IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF  ,0
"The last 13 years I've been procrastinating my suicide That's all I've been doing, all that's been happening, aside from the slightly distracting happenings I've observed through the fog. I've made a lot of ""progress"" with my mental health, I still am just trying my best every day, because my pain isn't as bad as the possible pain of my family. So I'm gonna keep on existing, but no matter what I do, I see no hope. I've felt dead, like a ghost, for so long and drugs have been the only time I escaped this feeling for short. I feel detached and isolated, no matter how much I pour out my ""soul"" to people, no matter how vulnerable I've learned to be. I'm in limbo, having to watch other people form connections with each other, maybe with me, but really, I'm far, far away.  
It doesn't matter how much you try to fill your life with beauty, if you're looking through shit-colored glasses.  
I'm always in waiting mode. I know it's not my time yet and I shouldn't accelerate it. But I'm just being honest with myself here. I'm always waiting, always looking forward to one thing, and that's to finally escape this prison of my mind once I die.",0

i dont get what about me is so repulsive to women. every other guy i know has had been in relationship by now except me. i either get friendzoned or just completely ignored, it makes me feel like i'm barely a human. i don't even know how im delusional enough to keep trying, but every time i do it just results in more failure. dont have many friends either so i just spend most of my time alone on the computer. my life is of very little value to anyone. really wish i could just die peacefully and painlessly in my sleep tonight, im already gonna die alone anyways ",0

"Praying I get terminally ill You ever say there and just hoped on everything in the universe that you get old you have some incurable illness with weeks to live?

Saying they understand because no one fucking understands this. I live my life in a constant state of stress, anxiety and fight or flight.

"I wish that my chronic health problems would kill me I am in so much pain every single fucking day because of psoriatic arthritis. I have degenerative disc disease in the entirety of my thoracic and lumbar spine, L4 is slipping over L5 slowly over time, my facet joints are all degenerating from t10 down, everything is starting to fuse together and now on top of all this bullshit I now have fucking thoracolumbar levoscoliosis which is making my back hurt even more. But with all of that and the other bullshit in my life nothing I have will kill me. It'll cripple me and cause unending agony until they day I die but hey, it's just not good enough to be stuck with that, no I can't even get anything to treat my pain either. I just had a series of injections into my spine that maybe worked slightly for 10 days. And they want to keep doing them. I mean who cares about the long term side effects of frequent steroid use, who cares if we fuck it up he can be paralyzed for life. But no, even tramadol is too fucking much. God I want to just splatter my brain across the ceiling of their office. Maybe they'd actually give a shit if someone fucking suckstarted a gun over their pain.

"Dear World, Why was I born? What purpose brought me here?
Will anyone remember me when I disappear?
Life is but a battle, an endless strife,
Yet I chose kindness, I chose love in this life.
I smiled through pain, yet was never seen,
Criticized, cast aside and left to glean.
What remains, is hope fading like a dream,
As I stand alone, wishing things had been.

Hope once tethered me to this earth,
And even now, I still dream of worth —
A peace that frees me from this night,
A final rest, a place of light. 
My dreams have crumbled, fallen apart,
I gave so much, yet lost my heart.
The hope I held that things would change
Has flickered out, now distant, estranged.

I’ve lost it all — those I held dear,
Born into a world I cannot adhere.
I’ve searched and wandered, both near and far,
For happiness like a falling star.
Perhaps it lies beyond this place,
A world where love does not erase.
Maybe the trees, the grass, the earth
Are souls like mine, seeking rebirth.

Perhaps I’ll be a tree one day,
Or lie on rocks where waters play,
Where warmth wraps me like a long-lost friend,
As I look up, waiting for the end.
I long for love, for hands that hold
As tightly as my heart grows cold.
I wish I’d leapt, I wish I’d flown,
To reach the place where dreams could have grown.

But fate, it seems, was not so kind —
This world will spin, leaving me behind.
I’m scared, I hurt, I don’t want pain,
Yet still my body fights back, in vain.
Why does my heart still beat, still break?
Why does it bleed when I can’t take
The burden of this hollow fight,
Alone in my mind like the dark of night.

I am tired, broken, lost in tears,
Crying through these endless years.
May those I love find peace, find grace,
Where I could not fill that empty space.
Live for me — live as I could not,
Thrive in ways I have since forgot.
And when I’m gone, please carry on,
Knowing I am where I belong.

May we meet again, where wrong turns right,
In another life, where hearts reunite.
With this final goodbye, I close my eyes,
Leaving behind all the hurt and lies.
In the quiet beyond, I’ll wait for you there,
Where peace and love may replace despair.
For all I’ve done wrong and couldn’t make right,
Maybe in the afterlife, I’ll find the light.

"I don't want to go to work tomorrow I don't have to and I think we alll know what I could do to make sure I never have to worry about work anymore

I've been thinking about it forever. The last time I grabbed my shotgun I told myself if I take it out I'm probably going to keep  it out until I do it.

Life keeps getting harder. Theres a disconnect between how much you want something, how much effort you put into something, and whether or not you life improves. It's backwards almost, the more I try the worse I feel. 

I'm trying to think of reasons to live, but I don't have anymore. The only reason I haven't fully committed is because I don't want to fuck this up like I fuck everything up. I don't want to have to survive in immense pain (more than usual I guess) and not have a say in how long my life is after I do everything I can to make it as short as possible.

Like, resources on how to aim and whether or not super handicap heavy target ammo would be more appreciated than really any amount of ""help""

"I hate being alive I don't like anything about life. I don't think living a life is worth it. There are not stories to tell. Nothing that I experience is worthy of reflection, consideration, or to be thought of as a ""story"" at all. 

I don't love people anymore. I don't have any feelings towards anyone. I don't care how other people feel, what they think, what they believe. I don't want to help them or bring value to them. 

I don't want to learn new things about the world or contribute to it in any meaningful way. 

I don't want to keep fighting to get out of poverty. On the other side of the hill I don't feel anything at all anyways. I don't feel happy to navigate the challenges of life. 

I am not grateful to be alive. Being grateful for having even the most basic things in life doesn't make any sense because those things can be just as easily taken from you by chance. And therefore even having a healthy body is completely useless and immaterial. Someone could rear end me and leave me crippled, or I could get cancer and become disfigured from life-saving surgery. What good is being alive if I would have to cope with those kinds of losses? I'm not even at that point yet, but I feel like it is innevitable.

There is nothing to make of my time on Earth. I do not feel inspired by anything. In fact I feel extremely resentful for being in the position of being alive. Having to navigate social skills. Having to provide value to others but not enough value or not the right kind thus keeping me struggling in poverty. I don't feel happy when I see my cat. I don't feel happy when I see my mom. I don't feel happy when I see children laughing and playing. I don't feel happy about anything. I can't laugh anymore. I don't feel grateful for not living in a war zone or other bad circumstances. I just feel an immense amount of fear and anxiety. Fear that what I try to do to get out of poverty won't be good enough. Fear that I don't have what it takes. The whole process just makes me want to kill myself anyways. I wish I just had the strength to cut myself open and let myself bleed. ",0

"I don’t want to grow up. I don’t want to be on my own. I don’t want to be alone. I have nothing to live for. If I don’t end up moving in with my friend in January, I’m going to end it.  I need for this move to happen. I don’t want to be alone another. This is my only motivation to wake up and go to work because i desperately wanna be with this person. I’m willing to build this person back up if it means having his presence to comfort me and give me a reason to live. He’s the only thing keeping me from ending it. Even if he does end up cheating on me, or he wrongs me, or he kills himself… at least i would’ve been with him during my last moments. I wouldn’t be alone. 

I’ve felt so alone my entire life. I had my parents sure but they didn’t like me. I was never in any of the family photos, never went to family parties, they would fight on who had to sit next to me at restaurants and then whoever had to sit next to me would face their body away from me. I never had any friends. My birthday was almost always forgotten. I’m 21 now. My birthday is on December 19. My dad died three years ago. I don’t talk to my sister. And my mom acts completely different towards me now because we have nobody left but ourselves. I’m starting to cry and yearn for my mom now that im older and circumstances have changed. I need my mom to be okay. There’s so much issues between us and i know she’ll never understand why I am the way I am but I just need her to live a happy rest of her life. I hope she finds a man who’s going to actually value her. Who’s going to take care of her. I really need to go to Portland, Oregon this January and start a new life. I know all these thoughts are going to follow me regardless of where I’ll go but at least, I won’t be alone. I’ll have someone around for once. He’s starting to tell me I love you again. I hope he doesn’t bail on me because he means the world to me… this move means the world to me. I want to make him happy; I want to heal him. Maybe, along the way, it’ll heal me.  I know nothing lasts forever but I hope we last at least two years. I want to know how to feels to be happy… at least this one time. ",0

To share each other's thoughts Doing so bad that I find myself starring at the walls of my flat, the screen of my phone, not being able to execute the simplest tasks. Another evening spent alone in a country that is not my original country. I just would like to talk to you guys to understand what bothers you and to tell you what bothers me. Just to help each other (as I interpret this subreddit). Sending you all a hug.",0
I bought a rope and I'm going to end it tonight  I can't live as a useless and unlovable person anymore. I wish I had a gun instead so I could put a hole in my ugly fucking face,0
"I’d love to hear about what you find beautiful / meaningful in life.  I’m really stuck right now in a spiral of terrible thoughts, ranging from not seeing any light in the past or future, to my brain trying to make a “plan” against my will. I’m spiraling hard in a way I’ve never spiraled before. (To keep things short and simple.) 

I need a light. I need some hope. I need a *distraction* most of all.

What’s your favorite thing about life? What do you find to be beautiful? Meaningful? What makes *you* happy? Tell me about your hobbies, your favorite music. Anything. 

(Side note) over the past year I’ve stared at this subreddit many times, wondering what to say, but feeling down on myself for feeling like I should post. I don’t know if it’s my dad in my head saying “you’re fine suck it up” or if it’s a fear of being perceived. But it’s so clear to me right now I need connection of some kind. Interaction. I don’t know. ",0
"How am I supposed to go on a lifetime like this? Hit my mid 20's and I've just started to process my childhood neglect and abuse, linking it with my lifelong depression. I had undiagnosed ADHD growing up, recently-ish diagnosed. Life was pretty hard, I acted out aggressively growing up despite having strong empathy and was massively conflicted. I think I felt I had to protect myself becuase I was abused by my father and brother at a young age, I also have a characteristic that made me the target in school and the street. I couldn't handle my emotions at all and attempted suicide by stangulation at 9 years old. I've had non-stop episodes of suicidal thoughts most of my life from the moment I go to sleep to the minute I wake up. They're from triggers of life stress and feeling as though it's my only way to escape my problems/feelings, but also just waking up after a few days of intense hapiness and hypomania to having instant pain in my chest when I breathe in with depression setting in. It cycles from hours, to days, to weeks. There's an insane amount of things to go into but it's too long. These patterns are something I've only just realised.

I moved out at 19 and improved a bit when I got my degree. I escaped the environment and became who I always wanted to be, but I'm embarrassed of who I was in the past. I've succeeded in most aspects of my life, apart from quite a lot of medical problems. But, I've started to see there's no escaping the mood swings and constant depression. I don't see how it's feasible for me to go on for a lifetime with this pain constantly in my life. Between mood swings I feel neutral and emotionless, I simply exist. I become overly energetic and talkative, reach out to people, to the point where I get embarrassed after because I feel I was too much. But then I suddenly become depressed. 

I can't connect with people at all on a deep level. I have a constant feeling of never being accepted (cliche right? it's not a phase mom). I don't really have anyone in my life. I speak to my parents occaisonally out of obligation and have no contact with the rest of my family. I'm starting to struggle with the emotions towards my parents and  the past, I've been ignoring them mostly.

The world is going to shit and I feel completely stuck. I've pushed myself to work hard through all the pain and somehow managed to do well, at a massive expense of my mental health. But inflation is crazy, I'll now struggle to get a decent wage and probably never have my own house. What was it all for? I feel so hopeless and stuck. I really can't go back to poverty so feel as though have to deal with the high stress, but I can't handle the stress anymore. I'm burntout, I don't know what to do. I'm so stuck.

Essentially no one knows what I'm going through and from the outside I have a perfect life. It makes it all feel so much more invalid. I really don't know what's wrong with me. I truly am starting to think that it's inevitable that I'm going to take my own life.",0
"I want to die but I don't want to make anyone sad I want to die but the thought of making my partner and family members sad is what keeps me here. 
I think about committing all the time. It just does not stop. I just want it all to stop.",0
How does it feel Really want to OD on muscle relaxers but so scared I’ll feel it… anyone know if it’s painless.. I just want to go painlessly soon,0
"I can’t die until after Christmas  I can’t stop thinking about suicide but I’m also trying to think of reasons to hang on.

Every plan I write down, I counter with something I need to wait for. 

Planning to jump off a bridge tomorrow? Well I can’t do that because no one will be around to feed my cats in the evening. 

Planning to overdose? But I’ve really been craving Chinese Food and takeout night isn’t until Friday.

Planning to hang myself? But i have two days off of work coming up and that means I get to sleep in, so why not hold off until afterwards.

I’m still making plans all the time. I still really, really want to kill myself. But I haven’t. I’m still here even for stupid shit like Chinese food. Fuck me. I just had to write this down so I don’t forget all the little things keeping me going. Maybe it’ll help someone else too.

"My Plan I am going to give it three weeks, I need to tie up my loose ends. 
I am going to kill myself in about three weeks. I am a single mom, but my parents will take my daughter. I have two cats my mom adores, I feel she will take them. 
I owe my job nothing, fuck corporate America. I am torn on my decision because I know I am going to hell, and frankly, it scares me. 

I plan to take a bunch of warfarin the week leading up to it so my blood will be incredibly thin. I am going to go to the river and find a spot and cut my wrists. 
I thought about shooting myself, but what a waste of a gun. 

I am hurting so bad, I can't breathe anymore. I am suffocating. God must have a wicked sense of humor. ",0
"I took the pills  I finally took all the pills and now I feel very shaky and jittery but I'm not sure if it's just my imagination. Earlier today I fell and smashed my penis so hard I felt like I was digesting extra fast. I hope they work because that was the final straw. My mom kept saying ""lemme check ya penis, lemme check ya penis just to make sure it's growing right"" and I said no and ran away, and my grandma was blocking the stairs saying ""ok hold it out, let me make sure it's not broken"" and I said no because I'm grown and don't want my family seeing my penis. I realized my dad saw my penis before (family court issues and all that) 

I went to my little brothers room and saw all of his friends there, despite him being 10 years old and all his friends being like  8-10, I went in there, we played and my dad came in there and checked my penis and everything was fine. We had sausages for dinner and it was my first time eating dinner with my family for like 5 years. For some reason I just don't want to be alive. It's too much work and I never really feel happy anymore anyway. I feel like happiness is only an illusion because it always leads to eventual disappointment. Every living thing in this world will someday come to an end",0
"Coworker Moderately disabled coworker, has been hospitalized before.  She is terrified of going back to hospital...was abused there the last time she was institutionalized.  I talked her down and got her to promise me a week until we work together again, then we can touch base.  I need to get her help, but she doesn't trust the hotline or police after what happened.  Any advice, i'm not a mandatory reporter but i don't want her to give in to the darkness. Is there another hotline i can call?",0
"Even though they'll mourn today, tomorrow they'll be at peace Today my parents will (hopefully) go shopping and my siblings can't really stop me because they're overseas, so I'm gonna take the chance to jump from an overpass today. I haven't really met anyone irl, but the people I've met online I should at least tell them, better than leaving them wondering what happened to me.

I know suicide is terrible for those left behind, but I'm sure everyone that knows and cares about me will get over it after I'm gone. I'm not really that important anyway.",0
"Every waking moment of my life is pain and I want it to end. I can’t do it anymore. I’m so miserable. With my virginity. My job. My social life. My anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, autism, ADHD. I can’t do this anymore. I feel like my life is over at 23.
