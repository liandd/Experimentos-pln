¿Pasar de ser pasivamente suicida a ser activamente suicida realmente me alivió? *¿Alguien más ha tenido esta sensación? ¿O lo ha encontrado relatable?,0
"He sido pasivamente suicida desde hace unos meses, pero ayer fue un día excepcionalmente horrible. Dormí hasta muy tarde, olvidé que tenía que ir a trabajar, no podía vestirme, no podía salir de casa, intenté arreglar mi bi	cicleta pero acabé rompiéndola aún más. Luego me entregué a casi to	dos mis vicios autosaboteadores (drogas, porno, comida de mierda, vide	ojuegos, de todo).",0
"Juro que algo se rompió. Lloré muchísimo durante todo el día y me pasé el resto de la noche leyendo febrilmente sobre el suicidio. De hecho, descubrí mi plan. Encontré un documento entero en el que se describen los detalles y se responde a todas las pequeñas preguntas que tenía (lo siento,	no compartir ni siquiera me preguntan), además de una opción de copia de seguridad en caso de que estoy lo suficientemente desesperado como para hacer algo más rápido. Por ahora, estoy en la etapa de adquirir los materiales y poner mis asuntos en orden.Desde que tengo mi método de suicidio resuelto, estoy en un estado de ánimo extrañamente optimista. Es una extraña paradoja. Finalizar mi plan de acción para acabar con mi vida me hizo sentir motivado para salir a vivirla. Estoy haciendo las tareas sin sudar, estoy bailando y escuchando música divertida, estoy recuperando partes de mi personalidad. Me he quitado un gran peso de encima.",0
"Por lo que he oído, es habitual que la gente se muestre tranquila o alegre los días previos al intento. ¿Es eso lo que estoy experimentando? Tal vez sea porque ahora tengo una meta? ¿Porque mis días ya no parecen carecer de sentido como antes? O puede que por fin haya una vía de escape para liberarme de la mierda de vida que llevo. Ya no me siento tan atrapado y desesperanzado.",0
"De todos modos, quería ver si esto alguien aquí tuvo una experiencia similar o quiere opinar sobre esta situación. Estoy activamente suicida por primera vez en mi vida y me siento mucho mejor después de que me di cuenta de mi método. ¿Cuál es el significado detrás de esto?",1
"El sistema escolar está hecho específicamente para ser un matadero de retrasados mentales como yo también podría suicidarme. Escucha, ya no tengo otra puta opción, la escuela, literalmente, sólo deja que los putos egoístas tengan éxito. Si no eres el tipo más seguro y diferente que pueden manejar, te joden, te mienten, abusan de su poder y te joden. Todo el	tiempo te echaránhumo por el culo sobre lo mucho que quieren que «triunfes».",1
"No estoy «triunfando», me estoy yendo al infierno. Siempre diciéndome que soy un «chico listo» ¿Qué tan estúpido crees que soy? ¿Honestamente crees que creo una palabra de lo que dices?	",0
"La escuela no «se preocupa por ti» la escuela no quiere que tengas éxito, la escuela quiere que te caigas por la puerta en la graduación y mueras en las calles para que los de tu clase sean conocidos como la «gente mala».",0
"Sí, así que puede que me ahorque en un baño o algo así. Si tuviera un arma me pegaría un tiro en su oficina, sólo yo, obviamente. Estoy pensando que probablemente solo me cortare en los baños por ahora amigo estoy enfermo viviendo una vida de mierda podria haber hecho mucho mas pero claramente mi	sangre	es mi unica voz por aqui.¡JODETE MUNDO!""""				",1
"No mejora. Si dices eso, te odio. 28 años he estado atrapado en este miserable montón de mierda. He malgastado miles de dólares hablando con gilipollas idiotas que no hacen más que ahogarme con metáforas sobre lo bonita que	es la vida, ¡y es bonita para esos cabrones	porque NO SON YO! Todo lo que he probado no ha aliviado en absoluto esta maldita maldición. He mandado a la mierda a mi terapeuta y he tirado las pastillas por el retrete porque ya he terminado con todo. Y si dices que mejora, puedes irte a la mierda con un pincho de ferrocarril cubierto de ácido porque ni siquiera sabes si eso es verdad. Así que vete a la mierda tú y todos los que piensen que ayuda.",1
"""Estoy tan deprimido que mis razones para suicidarme son cada vez más lógicas en lugar de irracionales. Es como si se me ocurrieran razones por las que es más lógico suicidarme que seguir vivo.",1

"Si no hay dios o vida después de la muerte, entonces me avergüenzo de ser esta forma de vida de tipo simio lanza mierda en lugar de algo con inteligencia mejorada e invulnerabilidad",0
Ya no puedo usar la ficción como vía de escape porque me hace sentir que esos mundos son reales y que podría ir a ellos si me suicidara.,1
"La gente que da vueltas sobre lo bonita que es la vida, curiosamente, hace que me den aún más ganas de suicidarme por lo absurda que es. En realidad no se lo creen, están bajo los efectos de la simple cafeína.",1

Ya no puedo	funcionar con normalidad. Ya	he intentado suicidarme tres veces por sobredosis de analgésicos, placebo, neurol y demás. Nunca he tenido nada peor que náuseas. Estoy planeando este intento para dentro de unas semanas, hace un mes compré 2 paquetes de paralen y 1 paquete individual de ibalgin. si me lo tomo todo (unos 70 comprimidos) y bebo alcohol, ¿realmente podría morir? Conozco los efectos secundarios y los posibles problemas de salud con el hígado y los riñones, etc., sinceramente me da igual. Sé que hay una pequeña posibilidad de morir, pero conozco casos en los que ocurrió y tomaron menos medicamentos. Yo tomé como mucho 20 paralens y no me sentí mal. por favor absténganse de estupideces, no digan que no debería hacerlo, que debería esperar tiempos mejores, etc. Realmente ya no puedo y no tengo el valor para suicidarme de una manera mas extrema.",1

"""Los últimos 13 años he estado procrastinando mi suicidio Eso es todo lo que he estado haciendo, todo lo que ha estado sucediendo, aparte de los acontecimientos ligeramente distractores que he observado a través de la niebla.

Así que voy a seguir existiendo, pero no importa lo que haga, no veo esperanza. Me he sentido muerta, como un fantasma, durante mucho tiempo y las drogas han sido el único momento en que he escapado de este sentimiento por poco tiempo.

He tenido episodios ininterrumpidos de pensamientos suicidas la mayor parte de mi vida, desde el momento en que me acuesto hasta el minuto en que me despierto. Se deben a desencadenantes de estrés vital y a la sensación de que es mi única forma de escapar de mis problemas/sentimientos, pero también al hecho de despertarme después de unos días de intensa felicidad e hipomanía y sentir un dolor instantáneo en el pecho al inspirar con la aparición de la depresión. Son ciclos de horas, días y semanas. Hay una cantidad insana de cosas para entrar, pero es demasiado largo. Acabo de darme cuenta de estos patrones.",0

It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments.

###Summary###,1
"**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.**",1
"###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###",1
"We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.",1
"But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**",1
"Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions.",1
"Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.",1
"In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world.",1
"**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**",1
###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###,1
Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.,1
"* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.",1
"*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding.",1
"* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines.",1
* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.,1
"To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.",1
###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###,1
Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.,1
"They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:",1
"* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.",1
"* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**",1
Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind:,1
"* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)",1
"* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.",1
Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.,1
"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.",1
"Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.",1
"But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable.",1
"Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.",1
"**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1
"I am 14f, a student in Korea. (South Korea, for the unfortunate ones who think internet exists in NK) I did make a post here before, but I deleted it because I felt a little paranoid about my mom going through my phone.",1
"(By the way, this is going to be super long, so unless you have nothing to do, please use your time to help someone else.)",1
"To put it simply, I'm under a lot of stress to go to a good university. And for that I need to go to a good high school. And for that, every single impression I make on teachers and test matters.",1
"And even if that weren't the case, I can't just 'take it easy' like my therapist suggests. Any time I'm not studying, like now, I feel like I'm falling behind and soon it's going to be too late.",1
"I've been feeling this way sometime since the pandemic. (Not because of it, just a rough timeline) I kept telling myself it would get better somehow, but it just kept getting worse and worse.",1
"Recently my mom found out about my self harm. She dragged me to a mental hospital, and I actually felt a little hopeful that things would take a turn for the better. But now I just feel like neither of them actually care about WHY I feel like this. They just want to drug me up with antidepressants so I can keep pushing through. (I don't think my mom knows how to help me. She is severely depressed herself)",1
"As for my dad, I'm fairly certain he doesn't know about the self harm, just that my mom used his card to pay for the mental hospital. He doesn't seem to believe in mental health, because he keeps insisting ""she's just going through puberty and stuff"". Now he's getting tired of my 'whining'.",1
"Anyway, my finals are on the day after tomorrow. And because my mental state has severely deteriorated the past few weeks, I have barely studied for it. Even if I didn't have to take the finals though, I just can't see things getting better for the next 4, 5 years.",1
"I just can't do this anymore. I don't WANT to do this anymore, because it's not worth it.",1
"I'm tired of going to school 5 times a day and pretending like nothing is wrong. I don't want to see my 'friend' who is technically sexually harassing me. I don't want to study study study anymore, and I'm tired of my parents who think I can just 'snap out of depression'.",1
So in  roughly 30 hours at midnight (10pm for NYC) I'm going to jump off my balcony on the 29th floor. The reason I'm making this post is because the kind people who tried to help after my first post deserve an explanation as to why I stopped replying.,1
"I feel so so sorry to my 2 friends at school, all of you who tried to help, my parents who probably tried their best.",1
"For the next 30 hours, I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want for the first time since... 4th grade, maybe?",1
"To everyone who cared enough to read this far, thank you.",1
how do i say goodbye to my family without making them take on my pain?,1
how do i say goodbye to fam without making them feel guilty despite it being their fault?,1
so i found a way to do it without pain other than emotional of course and i just have no clue how to go through with it.,1
"don’t get me wrong, there’s not one good reason for me to stay alive. i’m a trash human being who spent his entire 20’s being depressed and in my room over people who i wanted to care about the fact that i’m not a part of their lives anymore and mostly, it’s their fault, i just couldn’t take it that i cared for people more than they cared for me and then when our ways got separated, all of a sudden they took a part of my personality, ran with it and made their lives 10X better.",1
"regardless, i’m still the idiot who waited to be saved by my parents and my sisters, to be woken up and get yelled at straight to my face to never give up and always keep going.",1
"ppl who have support systems, whether they’re internal or external, are the luckiest people on earth. to go through life with the confidence that no matter what happens, the sun will come up tomorrow and you can try at it again.",1
that’s just a sentiment that i will never get to experience so trust me when i say that there is no other option.,1
"i’m 30 about to turn 31, have literally 0 friends, unemployed, broke and in debt, addicted to insanely disgusting porn because of feeling so worthless for so long, addicted to smoking weed mixed with tobacco therefore basically im a cigarette smoker, living with my mom who wishes that i didn’t and that I’d just wake up one day and be okay, which I don’t blame her cause i am spending away all the money she’s making from working her job. even tho i hate her, i hate myself for making my 70 year old mom work for my addiction, but i just can’t be seen by people anymore i just hate it i can’t even look myself in the mirror and i don’t remember the last time i did with the lights fully on.",1
"my dad lives abroad and im pretty sure i broke his heart from all the complaining i did in my 20’s over how he was always away for work when i was a kid and never actually cared about MY interests but kinda wanted to live vicariously through me so we don’t talk anymore cause he just makes me sad whenever we do, like every conversation with him ends up in a disagreement.",1
"i truly blame all of my family for the way my life turned out. i hate seeing on talk shows or interviews of successful people who were at their lowest points in their lives and they recall having one specific person who they claim if it wasn’t for them, they wouldn’t be where they are. like i know that people and connections are everything in this world, and it doesn’t make sense for a person who will never have those, to keep living his misrerable life spreading only hate.",1
"however much i may blame my family for my horrible life, i read a LOT about whether it’s worse for a family member to not get a ***^* note or to get one. im leaning towards writing one for each of them.",1
"if it wasn’t for my nephews and niece I really wouldn’t care but i am legitimately worried that my parents will first fall into the same black abyss that I feel into, and that my sisters will follow suit right after and I just don’t want them to grow up with parents that are just surviving every day, i don’t want to turn my sisters into walking zombies, but i hate them so much for putting themselves first and never caring about how im doing even tho im happy for them that they have normal lives.",1
i just start thinking about what id write and i always end up closing sentences with sarcastic like questions. what message can i write them even tho its their fault that’ll set them free from the stuff i was dealing with?,1
pls don’t DM me with messages like “i want to know your method” or some dumb “don’t give up”,1
you’re NOT helping! show some respect to a crying soul and comment ONLY if you have actual advice relating to my question,1
"I am a guy, 17, 5,7 and the amount of times I've been called ugly is crazy. I was bullied a lot in my school, I was once called ugly by my teacher in front of the whole class and everyone was laughing. I was called ugly randomly by girls and classmates and friends and family and was made fun of regularly. I was called unlovable by my cousin. Ugly by another cousin. And indirectly called ugly by my mom and dad. Also called ugly by random strangers. And same things again and again, almost everyday. I isolated myself after that. And have been isolated since 1 year. I can't bear it anymore. I have no friends. I can't live in like this being mocked and insulted and discriminated because of something I didn't even have choice for.",1
"I’ve always been the problem, literally from conception to present. I am a product of rape, my bio mom did everything in her power to pretend she wasn’t pregnant, I was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and pre-addicted to some narcotics. Bio mom refused to see me or touch me after birth, so I was held in nicu for 16 days while hospital staff looked for someone to want me. Got adopted and quickly realized I was a burden in the family, always needing extra care, having emotional problems/abandonment issues. First tried to kill myself in first grade, then again in eighth grade, freshman year, and junior year. Finally senior year I was almost successful but wound up in a unit instead. Everyone kept telling me, “it gets better,” and “eventually you will see how far you have come!” I’ve been struggling to stick around for years. Now I’m 30 and I’m really tired of always having to fake everything. I’m tired of not having friends, I’m tired of being alone, I’m tired of fighting for a sliver of happiness every day. I’m tired of it never getting better or easier. I’m tired of being a burden. I’m tired of being left out of everything. I’m tired of knowing that if I were to disappear, literally no one would notice until they needed something, yet I’m ALWAYS the one reaches out and checks in on people. After 30 years of trying to find the will to live, I’m really not trying to do it even one more day.",1
"As soon as I saw that train light in the distance something inside me made me get away from the tracks. I was 30 second away from death. After that asking my parents for therapy seems way less scary, I think I'm going to go to therapy but what the hell do I tell them? Does this count as a suicide attempt? I didn't hurt myself. There is no possible way I could have survived that if I stayed there. Idk why but I'm fucking terrified I cannot believe I was that close to dying. I was 30 fucking seconds away from fucking dying horribly. Oh my fucking god. I cannot believe this just happened. idk why I'm posting this, and I probably sound stupid.",1
"Guys it's been months and I shower every fuckin day, I no longer wear dirty clothes, I do the laundry regularly, and I do skin care and apply moisturizers, I drink more water too every day. I perfume every morning.",1
"At first it way trying and failing for years, then my heart fell for someone and somehow I'm more willing to do better for myself in everything",1
Want one so bad,1
And that’s a cruel joke.,1
"I feel like I’m mourning my life already and that I’m slowly deteriorating but I don’t actually have an “end date”. Or, that is, I don’t know my end date. I’m 26. I don’t have any chronic illnesses outside of depression and anxiety. I’m actually really healthy.",1
Sometimes I think I’d be happier if I was actually dying. I could embrace the deterioration more and make the best of it. I feel SO guilty because I know there are people who have cancer or lupus and wish they weren’t dying.,1
"Im autistic and generally don't fit in, I've been called weird all the way from childhood, and now into adulthood. I've been friendless for a lot of my life.",1
"I don't think this will ever change, I feel like a nuisance to everyone around me and no one would miss me if I'm gone.",1
"(BTW this is quite long and prolly jus me being too sensitive bout it I just wanted to vent) About 2 months ago I was accused of saying some sexual things about a girl in my class, since i was new to the school no one really believed me. I was suspended so that lead to everyone knowing bout it. I get bullied every single fucking day for this. All i can do is ignore the bullying as the school has told my parents i could get expelled if i get into any trouble. I tried reporting the bullying but the teacher doesnt give a shit. Its to the point that even my parents dont believe me. Everyday of my life is the same constant shit. This has led to me not doing as well academically either. I v got my GCSEs in a few months and if i dont do well in them im cooked. I just dont really know what to do anymore, ik im prolly jus being a pussy and i should jus ignore this stuff but its hard to when everytime i get those looks in school that say "" Ew its the guy who said that"". Shits been different as home as well. Sometimes I sit there and think what have i done wrong to go through this shit, maybe i am not a good person at heart maybe i deserve this, that constant turmoil in my head the voices that say im not good enough, its all too much. I need to get into a good uni becuase i wanna pursue medicine as my career but the grades im getting right now arent good enough for it.",1
P.S. the reason my parents dont belive me is cuz iv lied to them alot bout stuff like having an insta account and telling them im studying whilst watchin  a movie or smth( idont blame em),1
"I guess this is my goodbye letter. Funny cause I never thought I’d end up like this, but here we are. So yeah, I just took about 310,000 mg of methanol, and now I’m lying on the floor, waiting. Not sure how much longer I’ll stay awake tbh.",1

I want someone to love me,1
I won't kms because I have Mt dog and cat,1
"Without me, no one will care for them",1
Especially not my boyfriend nor my abusive mother,1
Grandma's in end stage cancer and can't remember my name most days,1
I'm fucked,1
What do I do?,1
I cry everyday. It's a struggle to even get up. Im a vet tech. I got home to my bf with the door locked... I guess I got kicked out  I don't know,1
Whatever my boyfriend's dad loves me and my dog Goose and cat Pot roast so I'm in the living room of his house.... I didn't explain why but he didn't ask..he's nice he loves me.,1
Ugh maybe I'm a bitch for thinking anyone would help. It's not my debt either..,1
I wanna say goodbye to my grandma and Everytime I go to my childhood home it's immediately pain and anger,1
Everytime it's screaming yelling hitting throwing blaming,1
I go to a methadone clinic everyday for 3 years now,1
Once again I ruined it all over my mom's abuse.,1
I would do anything for a best friend or love I want love so bad,1
# Why do I have to keep living if I didn't ask to be born in the first place?,1
Genuinely looking for a real answer here. Idk why I’m still here. I wish my first suicide attempt worked and I wish I wasn’t so much of a coward to just do it,1
Do people who drink to death feel pain when they die.,1
"I can't stand my life anymore and I don't feel afraid of death anymore, I really just want to end it all. But I can't even do anything right, it felt like my neck was going to break in two and nothing happened, here I am with some neck pain.",1
"What do I do now? I really feel lost after this, it was my only solution. I don't know what to do with my life (or un-life).",1
I don’t know where to go. I likely have some sort of brain damage so all I can think of is this random group off of Reddit.,1
"I don’t want to die, but suicidal ideation haunts every corner of my life. I don’t have anyone who takes me seriously because I’m a broken record of absolute agony. I’ve written letters multiple times, planned multiple outlets, but I’m still here. So no one important to me takes me seriously. They think I’m trying to be manipulative. But I grew up around suicidal bipolar people. They all killed themself. I feel like it’s written my stars but I’m trying to be the one who survives. It’s so hard because I’m not a good person. I’m trying to make up for years of being awful/validating my self extermination but I’m alone in it. No one believes in me. I even sometimes get told it’s just going to happen. I’ve done some deplorable things so that my loved ones only have faith in my inevitable young death at this point. I’ve self sabotaged and sabotaged my relationships around me that mean the world to me. I just need friends who can encourage me to get through it. Friends who can see me for the person I’m trying to be now, the guy trying to get away from the careless and deplorable and lazy and ugly person he was before. I’m not trying to downplay or act like I can ever change what I’ve done, beyond putting Alf work in to stop this cycle, but I just want to improve. I’m so tired of being miserable. Change can happen but with my mental illness and the situations I keep creating… I’m scared I won’t last. I have no one to talk to except for my wife who is directly affected by me so…. I really shouldn’t. I",1
Don’t feel in my heart she should deal with me. I don’t feel like she should be the one to help me because I’ve left her defenseless.,1
"I need friends who need friends too. I need people who want to do better and need support. Be it you already have support, or need it. Where can I find community for this?",1
"I have planned my suicide, and set the date of 15th January, and feel the best I've felt in a long while.",1
"I am giving my family a nice Christmas, something they can remember me by. I also chose to do it after December so future Christmas' were not ruined for them by any negative emotions.",1
"I have picked up Deadly Nightshade seeds, enough to hopefully act quickly making me unconscious, and stop my heart within a few hours. I have also stockpiled my anti depressants as a failsafe, with Serotonin Toxicity Syndrome.",1
"To prevent any hallucinations and delirious actions, which are apparently common with Atropa Belladonna, I'll take as many sleeping tablets as I can source before then.",1
"I don't want to leave, but I also don't want to stay. I am stuck in the mindset of just wanting everything to be over. To stop the constant mental fatigue, and to stop trying to 'survive' in a world that doesn't feel like it has any point.",1
"Planning has helped. It's given me the freedom to enjoy 'now', but there is still the black hole in the horizon that scares me, excites me, and reassures me.",1
I don't want an afterlife. I don't want to be reincarnated. I just want everything to be completely and totally over with for me. I'm completely miserable. I hate everything and my life. I'd definitely be better off dead.,1
I'm sick of being told because I have autism I will be lonely forever,1
I'm sick of being told I will never own a home because I have autism,1
I'm sick of being told I can't do things because I have autism,1
I'm sick if being put in a box with everyone else who has autism because everyone on the spectrum is different,1
I'm sick of being given different advice from different people and then being heavily criticized and personally attacked if I don't follow their advice as if I'm wrong,1
I'm sick of being told nothing is wrong with me even though I wish there was nothing wrong with me.,1
"I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel I have conpletely lost my purpose if I didn't years ago. I am 23. I have never had meaningful friends, never had a partner or been to parties. Never really had any sort of fun. I don't want sympathy I want advice because that is the only thing that will give me purpose, something to work on.",1
"I refuse to accept I can't change just because I have autism. I dislike the label so badly, and family tells me to not tell people because it's often seen as a negative and ruins your chances. And that it is better to be seen as ""weird"" than being seen as ""disabled"" even though it is not a disease.",1
"I am struggling mentally, I am not eating properly or sleeping properly thanks to my never-ending racing throughts about this stuff. I am sick of being told I am rude just because I don't ask questions to people, It's not that I am disinterested, It's because I am socially awkward and I don't know how to change.",1
"No paychologist has helped me. and I struggle to trust them especially when I have a brother who tells me they caused him so many problems and that he is happier since he stopped seeing them, and that he has no ""issues"" with social skills. But he is more mild than me.",1
Am I actually screwed like society thinks I am? allot of people think people like me are a waste and a loser and that just makes me not want to be here anymore. What do I do?,1
I am so close to commitment. I need to know a method that would allow me to pass away without any pain and without any panic. I am so sad. I am so disappointed in life. I am sooo sooo sooo sad. I feel like waiting for better days are unfair suffering. I just want to end it.,1
"I want to die. How can i do it without pain and panic. Opiates, carbon monoxide poisoning or nitrogen, top options so far.",1
I just want to go peacefully and painful. I am so sad.,1
"It's horrible when everyone around me is asking me what I want for Christmas, I'm doing for the holidays, if I'm looking forward to breaks.  I can barely think about moving forward in time right now.  All I can think of is how much I want to tear open my wrists and my neck.  Horrible gruesome thoughts about mutilating my face and body and ending it all are a frequent occurrence throughout the day now.  And I can't help but like such a burden and a failure.  I'm still without a job, my mother helped me purchase a car a few months ago, and my health is degrading again.  It seems no matter what I'm just causing misery for the people surrounding me.  Alive I'm a lazy, worthless freeloader and dead I'll have wasted everyone's time, money, and effort to help me get better.  Either way it's just painful for everyone and it's all my fault.  I want to kill myself, but I can't because it'll ruin my family's Christmas.",1
found out some horrible shit today. the worst thing that’s ever happened in my life worst than anything else. i was already hanging on by a thread. i’m trying so hard not to do it. pls send me any kind words of support i can not leave my kids. i have to make it thru the day. i need to.,1
Is overdosing sleeping pills painful? how would i die?,1
"I hate humans. Theyve disregarded me, talked down on me, and treated like I'm less than or don't exist my entire life. So I will off myself and make sure nobody will know my corpse exists either. If Im gonna be disregarded while living, disregard my body too. I don't want a muthafucka to ever see or know. I will disappear with my dead body since I've been invisible to everybody my entire life. Where can I do the deed and nobody find me ever? In the pacific ocean?",1
"I hope when the time comes, I won't hesitate. I just want to be free.",1
"I’m 18, and I’ve been struggling and thinking about ending my life every day.",1
"Hi, I’m an 18-year-old male, and life has been incredibly difficult. I’m trying to keep myself together, but I always think about ending it every night. I’ve attempted before, but something or someone always stops me or catches me.",1
"When I was young, my family broke apart. I was just a kid then, but the memories are so traumatic. I’ve been having the same nightmare ever since. It was about the day our house was completely destroyed, and my dad decided to keep us, even though our mom wanted custody. My dad has been abusive ever since. I’m so traumatized that even a simple touch makes me flinch and push people away.",1
"Then came even more family problems. Even my grandfather hurt me, and he was also a predator, especially toward my cousin. I was just a kid, and no one cared about me at school.",1
"When I was in Grade 7, I ran away from home because the abuse had gotten so bad. My stepmom was also abusive and constantly reminded us that she wasn’t obligated to take care of us. I stayed with my aunt, and that’s where I first tried to end my life with a knife from the kitchen. But my grandfather suddenly came in, so I had to hide it.",1
"I can’t share every detail of what I’ve been through, but here’s what’s happening now. I’m in Grade 11 at DLSU-D. Things were okay during the first term, but after that, people started destroying my reputation. I feel so ashamed to go to school because my classmates and everyone around me have been spreading lies about me.",1
"Even though I stay silent, they continue to ruin my image. Now all my classmates hate me because of the rumors people spread, and no one believes me. Even now that we’re in Grade 12, they still haven’t stopped.",1
So much inner conflict and turmoil. A lot of it at my own expense. I struggle from ADHD and several other undiagnosed mental disorders I’m sure.,1
Just been feeling like my life is going no where. I often use weed to numb out the feelings but even that is starting to take its toll. Soon I fear there will be no relief.,1
"Been trying the video game streaming thing but if I’m being honest, as much hope as I’m trying to muster hope, I just don’t think it’s feasible.",1
A lot of financial problems. Living on welfare. Unmotivated. Unemployed. The list keeps stacking I’m afraid.,1
"I know a lot of people face these struggles too. And it’s probably my own selfishness but I just feel like everyone but me is moving on up in life. Getting careers, partners, etc.",1
"I’m 27 years old and I’ve been thinking lately that if I haven’t done anything substantial for myself by 30 then I’ll just end it. I don’t wanna wake up one day and be 80 realizing I wasted my life away. :,( which is ironic because suicide would essentially be doing that. But at least I’d be in control of something for once… feeling tired.",1
"Like seriously, only thing stopping me right now is thinking about some people that I don't want them to feel guilty about my death, so I would rather see them one more time and tell them I love them and then just take off.",1
"I want my last day to seem pretty normal, like nothing bad had happen.",1
I even want to smile and laugh like crazy,1
And I wanna be so social and confident,1
Ugggghhhhhh but at the same time who fucking cares I just wanna die right now.,1
"I have severe treatment resistant depression, my life is dull and boring with constant pain, never had any love in my life i am emotionally blunt.",1
"I live in poverty in a third world country, my financial status is non existent.",1
"That's why i decided to check out. I'll be missed by 2 or 3 people, but they'll get over it.",1
Peace.,1
I’m 15m living in Australia and I took 8000 mg of paracetamol last night hoping it kills my liver again. I have done this before and have gotten help after telling people and was treated. I also have tried overdosing on my adhd medication which killed me and I was brought back. This time I am not telling anyone close to me and I’m going to let it kill me,1
"Earlier this year I had a complete physcotic break for the first time in my life. Before my hospitalization I threw out half my valuables including all electronics, clothing & accessories I liked.",1
I ended up being hospitalized for two months and put on a lot of anti physcotics.,1
My episode caused me to lose a community of people I considered best friends. Which has ultimately lead to a big depression.  I also am unable to work as a result of this.,1
I've talked to my doctors about different medications since my anti depressants really aren't working and they aren't budging on changing my meds which is really frustrating.,1
"My insomnia is awful, I struggle to leave my place and go outside. Each day just feels like the last and has no point to it.",1
I've been self harming through binge eating.,1
I've gone to a couple places which I considered ending it however I've chickened out or gotten put back in the hospital for telling my plans.,1
I'm just tired of feeling alone / like a shell of a person and constantly feel like people would be better off without me.,1
"Hi all! I just want someone to know that I'll be gone in a bit. I've injested rat poison and I'm going to die very soon, with any luck.",1
"I don't make this decision lightly. There is value to life and life can be incredibly interesting and wonderful. There's a lot to explore. However, since my diagnosis of Bipolar Type 1 with Psychotic Features, after my first psychosis, life has been pretty hard.",1
"I've rebuilt my life after 1.5 years, after my first psychosis but I still suffer every single day from the aftershocks. It's been hell for me.",1
"I've done a lot in my 23 years of life, more than some have in their entire lives. I've performed and led school productions, won a few singing competitions, done well academically, started charity drives and fundraisers, headed a volunteering club, made a 100k before I turned 22 through investments, travelled all over the world and visited a shit ton of countries, done well in the army, been a good friend to the people I care about, and ticked about 50 items off my bucket list. I'm happy with what I've accomplished and I'm ready.",1
"Sayonara yall,",1
Have a good life.,1
Edit: p.s. I'll be deleting my account in an hour,1
"moms dying of cancer, im mentally disabled, physically disabled, have ptsd, im poor, lost my family, half of them are dead now, im hearing voices, im seeing shit, i live in somebody elses hoard, i am coughing up blood, im gay",1
at this point bruh im not even gonna cry about it i gotta laugh,1
"I was doing pretty well keeping my suicidal thoughts at bay for some time, about 5-6 months. I've been in a traumatic situation with a loved one for the last 2-3 months or so, and i've been waiting around to die ever since. It fills me with such immense pain in despair, in such an unprecedented way. I thought I had reached the absolute pinnacle of pain and suffering in the past (gullible, I know), but this situation pains me so so much more. Every waking moment is such a challenge. Panic attacks, constant sobbing, not eating, having nightmares, not sleeping, shaking. I'm so over it.",1
"I've tried everything I could to get better and ease the pain, but none of it works. I can still only focus on the pain, the situation I am, and my former loved one. It's on my mind 24/7, and never escapes, even in my dreams and nightmares. It's all-consuming. I fear the only way I can rid myself of her and of this situation is to lose consciousness, permanently is fine. I know one day I could get better, but I don't want to get through this anymore, and I don't want to let her hurt me anymore. It's not worth the effort — the effort fair outweighs the reward. I hate my body, my mind, and everything it's been put through.",1
"I've been thinking about it, and i'm not afraid anymore. The sum of each days physical and mental struggle far outweighs any physical pain from the act of suicide. Suicide is easy by comparison. And I really shouldn't make it any of my business how people react to my death, i've spent far too much time and energy on that. Eventually, time will pass, the idea of me will vanish, and it won't even matter. I just hope my mom ultimately comes to understand why her once sweet, lovable child felt the need to end his life prematurely. I want her to be happy, have a good life, and experience minimal grief when i'm not around. I'm sorry to everyone who cares but I can't do it anymore, i'm going to allow life to take me, and I hope that i'm never found.",1
"I didn’t even do anything. I just expressed that I was having suicidal thoughts and I was sent to the hospital. Thankfully, the hospital did not admit me. But the school forced my roommate to move out. (Which actually makes things worse because now I’m alone with my thoughts) and the school is also having security check up on me every 30 minutes. Do you think they’re going to kick me out of school? I get it’s a huge liability. But I didn’t even do anything.",1
"My body is a prison and a burden. I wish I could wake up and suddenly have the right chromosomes and the right genitals. But that’ll never happen. I drink heavily to cope. I can’t stop spiraling and it’s made the community I belong to hate me. I’m a hateful piece of shit and that alone is why I should kill myself. I just want to have the balls to actually kill myself. But I don’t even have balls lol, it’s ironically funny. Being trans is a fucking burden. Especially being a binary trans man. And being a gay one is a death sentence too so why shouldn’t I try?",1
"I don't want to live. I hate being a girl. Its disgusting, i'm disgusting. I hate it. I was a mistake. If I'm not, then why aren't I a boy? Its bullshit. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm just not.",1
"I am completely replaceable, I offer nothing of value to anyone around me, I'm a leech, I'm worse than worthless and once I'm gone I'll be forgotten in a week, guaranteed",1
edit: I knew nobody would really care,1
After 4 years im finally going…,1
I was in love with this girl. Truly in love. We talked so much. We were so fucking close. I destroyed it. By accident. I fucking destroyed everything because I was so scared.,1
This always happens. I get close to someone then I push them away. I didn't even mean to. I loved her. I loved her so deeply. Now I can't even say hi. She hates me. I fucked up so badly and I can't fix it.,1
It always fucking ends up like this. Always. I think I'll forever be alone at this point. I just want to love. I have such a big heart and I can't give it to anyome. I just want to love.,1
"My life, my self, my existence—— it is too much to bear. I thought a broken person like me could finally be happy, but I ruin it like everything I touch.",1
"Every person I come across, I bring into my black hole of self-destruction. I have them questioning a future with me, I broken them with my own self-hatred, and I felt every hope leave.",1
I don’t think I have any light to look forward to. What does one live for if everything leaves? And you’re all alone?,1
"I don’t have anything anymore. Like one says, they’ll heal with time after I’m gone.",1
"I can't take it anyomore. I'm so fucking useless I don't deserve any of the things I have. My life could be SO amazing if I didn't have this mentality, if I wasn't as sick as I am, but all I find are reasons to end this. I'm on medication, I'm sick in the head and I fear nothing can help me anymore. Why do I feel like this? My music teacher scolded me and now I'm falling into a self-hate spiral, thinking about slicing my wrists and taking a handful of my risperidone. Funniest shit ever. It just triggered all the usual thoughts, ''you're trash'', ''you're useless'', ''you're nothing''. I've had this sort of impulsivity and mood swings for a while now, I'm in the process of getting (or not getting) a BPD diagnosis, but my psychiatrist is hesitant of diagnosing disorders. I hate it. I want to know wtf is wrong with me. I hate myself, I hate everything. I just can't be  happy. I want to skip school and just rot in bed, wallow in my own misery. Thinking about all the bad things my suicide could bring just makes me feel worse.",1
"Im sick and tired of being alone, to the point im almost ready to kms.",1
What is it? Am I alone? Do someone have the same feeling?,1
I can't go on with the horror of existence,1
"my life is completely ruined and I'm going to be homeless soon.i have severe health issues, especially dental from purging and falling on my face while heavily drugged. I spend 16-18 hours a day sleeping and just stare at the wall in terror the rest of the time",1
I have a tremendous amount of strong rc  benzos  left and soon temperatures will reach freezing here.,1
if I mix a certain amount of Benzos with vodka it forces me to sleep often with even me noticing,1
"could I just go outside at night into a forest, take as many benzos as I can and drink a whole bottle of vodka and then fall asleep, freezing to death?",1
everyone in my country loses their virginity early..since fifteen I've seen everybody else lose it but not me,1
"I felt undesirable, unattractive..sexually unappealing",1
"there was such a rough phase,i would have so many issues with alcohol and self harm..months spent drinking until sickness,eventually i slowed down but i kept suffering",1
"blood,i couldn't get out of bed from the cinder blocks tied to my ankles made out of depression,hatred,evy and feelings of unworthyness",1
"I liberated myself through my own blood, I would skip classes and self harm all day until the crimson smell of tormented blood filled the room",1
"death marched towards me, and I hoped it would complete its march..i was fine with dying since a young age and if in life I was never wanted I would be liberated in death",1
but it never came.,1
it never did.,1
"it was a cold winter, the kind of cold that slowly gnaws at your own skin, but in my mind it started to be spring",1
"I felt as if I was lying on beds of flowers, and even as I was bruised, battered and bleeding something was forming..some kind of hope",1
"maybe it was not my time to die yet, so I twisted my own fate",1
someone who seemed to want me found me..but it was a lie,1
"every time I attracted someone it was never because they found me attractive, always because they wanted a romantic partner, someone to settle with..and the same went with her",1
i broke up with her after she kept shaming me for being a virgin..months later she accused me of kidnapping her..tragicomedy at it's peak,1
"the dulleroded switchblade..that brown tint, it looks like coffee but the smell of your own blood you can never forget",1
the pills of xanax..the ones i used to push myself further during the mutilation of my own self,1
"spirits, the spirits I used to drink first thing in the morning",1
"..death,death wanted me..and i wanted death,but something inside of me just refused to die",1
that spirit of survival..no amount of mutilation could snuff out and to this day I have no idea what it is,1
life enforcing..all i wanted was to die,1
"the blade could barely open, the blood eroded it's opening mechanisms, almost as if my own old blood was telling me 'please, not again'",1
"yes, again,and again.",1
it's over.,1
"i woke up with the smell of blood on me,my skin tore open",1
"blood was running down on me,like all the tears i could not shed during years of agony having new life through the blood i shed",1
"eventually,i would have reached my release,every single cut led me one step closer to freedom",1
"a slave which bangs his own head against the wall,with every single strike leading him closer to the eternal peace",1
"..how i got here now,i have no idea..",1
"i started making friends,enjoying the night life and finally,some people started wanting me",1
"..i am so close,but every time i go to sleep i feel the reaper running his hand through my hair like a mother would to lull her own child to sleep",1
every waking minute i spend in lonelines..i am doubting my decision,1
"if this is another false hope,please make it quick",1
"my skin burns,my knives are dull..please kill me quickly and now if i got to die,i tell myself",1
the more i keep pushing..what felt like a dream back then slowly turns to reality....but i cannot stop thinking about the eternal relief of death,1
"help..it's close..it's almost over and even though i know the emotional trauma and the psychological complexes will linger,i can finally start to live",1
"i don't know what to do,i don't want that torture,that punishment again",1
"i'm so young,i just wanna live..fuck",1
"Hello,",1
"so, yeah, I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Probably just to distract myself, but it’s honestly no use. I hate being here, and the idea of ultimate liberation evokes a pleasant feeling deep inside me. I’ve heard people say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I like that. And this is exactly what I need.",1
"326 meters should be enough, considering I’ll be hitting a concrete pavement. I only hope I don’t fall on anyone unfortunate enough to be below and drag them down with me.",1
"If you’ve made it this far into my rant, I wish you all the best in life. Hopefully, you’ll find something worthwhile for yourself. :)",1
"I’m in so much pain, I think I’m going to slip my wrists here. I a razor or something sharper in my bag I just want it done. I just didn’t want my soul to break. I do hope my family forgive me.",1
"21 y/o male, not really suicidal, but sometimes think, that... all that i could have been... is now kaputt, and my potential is wasted forever. I will never recover and at best, my life will be an ongoing struggle. And maybe...sometimes... it's best if i stopped holding on and i just gave up on this failed project that is me. I just wish, i wasn't dealt these cards, but it cannot be changed... I know others have it worse than me, but i'm so fucked in the head, i don't know how to change it. I'm just a weird person. ty for listening ig",1
Seems like no one has time for me or even if they do I can’t share certain things with them.,1
"All I'm doing now is trying to figure out how many pills to take and when to do it. I only have access to otc meds. trying to look up how much will kill me is difficult to say the least. I've tried overdosing before and it didn't work, I just felt like I had a fever so I'm hoping if I just take a handful with alcohol that'll do the trick.",1
"I've thought about making notes but I don't really see the point anymore. My parents hate me, I don't have friends, I don't go outside, I don't have a life, I'm a completely unimportant, a waste of air. I wanted to stay for my little brother and my grandma but I think atp they'll cope, I'm done.",1
"my boyfriend of 6 months broke up with me because i was ""too much"". i didnt know i was too much. while he was struggling with merely me, i was in a relationship too, on suicide watch, parents divorcing, losing one of my best friends, and watching as all my grades slip. i was going through so much more. but my friend told me ""everyone has different limits"". i didnt know his limit would mean breaking up with me. i thought we would last longer. i shouldve known this was bound to happen though, cause when i was in the hospital for my OD suicide attempt, he didnt care to ask if i was okay, he was too busy playing fortnite. it upsets me that i feel so betrayed over a boy who couldnt even love me right. i feel like theres nothing left to live for.",1
"If anybody wants to get drunk together, I’d be more than happy to talk to you! I thought people cared, but only a few do.",1
I just wanna be drunk with people I can relate to.,1
"I’m sorry for being a fuck up, sometimes I feel like the lord himself doesn’t want me to live.",1
when i die... i'm scared of being a shitty person in the next life. cus then i'll have a shitty life in the life afterwards. it'll just be an endless cycle of inflicting pain and feeling pain... what did i do so wrong to deserve issues like this now? is this karma? is this revenge? did i murder? did i bully? did i lie? does this mean i should die? i'm so tired of the cycle. i don't ever want to be a shitty person ever. i don't want to have shitty life either though.,1
Im sad all the time,1
"It's been 2 months now since my bf dumped me and I'm still not dealing well. I try hard not to let it show in front of him especially since we work together but sometimes I just get overwhelmed and I can't deal with it. It just seemed so sudden. Sometimes I just react suddenly and get upset. It hurts so bad. And then he gets antsy. Keep hoping I'll get him back but when I act out it's probably not helping bc I'm probably just driving him further away. Idk if i can deal with the sadness and pain much longer. It hurts so bad. I can't imagine my life without him. I've been losing a lot of weight and crying and drinking and contemplating ways to end my life. I was talking with a couple of my friends from work but i don't want to keep bothering them, so I've mostly gone silent.",1
"I have been going to therapy for many years now, and although it has helped me in many aspects of my life, I have relapsed badly. I have discussed this with my therapist, and she is aware of my suicidal thoughts, but lately they have stopped being just thoughts. When I am at my worst, I can't get the thought of ending it all out of my head, and lately I have been planning what that will look like.",1
"I have been struggling with all of this for many years, but this latest relapse seems the worst. I can't wreck my family's life, so I need help, but I don't know how to ask for it. I feel like I'm failing everyone, including my therapist, so I'm very embarrassed to have to talk about this, and I don't know how to go about it. Any ideas?",1
Thank you for reading me.,1
"I can't get out of my dead end job because I'm worthless to other companies, my own company won't pay me more, promote me, give me a better shift, or recognize anything I've done. I've finished half a degree, and gotten four certifications directly applicable to my job while I've worked there and they don't fucking care. I was turned down for every better job there I applied without any real interview, and was not given the employee of the year in my department when the person that won has no educational background and shows up to the office far far less than I do. I have to do shit jobs that no one else has to do, so clearly all I am is fucking shit. I'm really fucking close to just fucking ending it all. I'm fucking worthless anyway, so what the fuck is the point of living?",1

"I don't know what to call this but desire for death out of bordem. No career goals seem worth it, substance abuse doesn't make it better, neither does getting in relationship. It just feels empty.. I don't know how else to explain this feeling. General nihilism I guess..",1
"been meaning to write one for a while but i keep putting it off cos i dont know what to write anymore. ive sat with an empty word document for about 40 minutes now. last time i wrote one was in december 2023, and that feels like it was only a few weeks ago but its been a whole year haha.",1
"i used to write this type of shit all the time but these days i literally dont know what the fuck to write. i cant use my old ones because i dont feel that way anymore. i was so emotional and dramatic back then, makes me feel sick tbh. but atleast i was motivated. now i feel so numb and cant be fucked with anything.",1

"I'm giving myself one last month to show me i'm worth of my life, i'm giving myself a whole month to show that i can change and that i'm not that much of an egoist, a parasite or even just a bad person, if the 7th january i did not make any change about how i act towards my family who love me or even my friend, i'm just gonna take the stairs to the roof and make a last step.",1
"People gave me too many chances and i always disappointed them and even tought i know this time will prolly not be different from the others times i wanted to change and i'll prolly just writing this to myself to have a motivation to do it when the day will come i guess? Like i'll be telling myself ""do it you can't take back what you said on that reddit post that only one random guy saw by a missclick"" i don't even know what i write this for, i'm just a waste of a man, never did anything with my life and will never do.",1
"I just dont get it, i'm loved by my family, they support me through everything, even if i quit school i had what it takes to have good grades, i'm trying a school at home by internet but i'm spending my days brainrotting myself with video games and sitcoms instead of doing it, i have everything but for a reason i dont know my brain wont let me be happy, i'll always find a way to ruin it all, to mess with my life and making it worse and i cant control it.",1

"it is not about it being ""icky"" or anything , it is the fact that i suffer consequences from it , it gave me a myriad of different kinds of disabilities that i'm unable to get rid of and that heavily affected my life .... how can i not feel suicidal ? anyone got answers other than whataboutism that my family is master of or sayings like 'it gets better"" ??",1

I failed last night. Threw up and went to bed instead of following through. But I said goodbye to everyone. My kids are still with my grandma. I still have time to do it. I've been letting the house air out all morning. I took down the notes I wrote. They'll need to be picked up soon.,1
"But I still want to do it. I know, objectively, that they're intrusive thoughts. They're not me. The things they tell me to do aren't who I am. But that doesn't help. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of nasty, awful, vile thoughts. As far back as I can remember.",1
"I'm evil. I'm bad. If people knew the thoughts in my head, they would want me to be dead, too. I'm not a good person.",1
We are the choices we make. I want to believe that. I need to believe that. I'm not the person the voices want me to be. I try so hard to do the right thing. I try and try and try.,1
But I'm so tired.,1
I gave in and texted a friend. Told her what I did last night. But I stopped responding hours ago. Am I not worth another text? Does no one take me seriously? Do I just not matter?,1
"I was asking for help for an hour at most, shouting from our top floor. I was locked up. It's midnight. It's a blur how I managed to get through. After grasping what happened, I realized I am alone. I live with my family but I'm alone. I will die alone. No one will realize I'm gone.",1
I'm so tired of feeling this way.,1

"My boyfriend broke up with me today. I’ve been struggling with depression almost my entire life. No medication ever helped me, and I don’t want to try any more. Therapy didn’t help. Trying harder didn’t help. Doing the right thing didn’t help. I go through a lot of pain every single day. I picked up a heroin habit to get some relief from the constant suffering.",1
"I think I’m going to slit my wrists open once again, this time while on the highest dose of heroin possible while still being able to move my arms. I’ve seen enough of my life to realize that it’s not worth living. I tried my hardest to make my life better, I’ve gone through too much pain in my 17 years of living. Good luck everyone.",1
sorry for the bad english,1
i feel so down。i do not know why i dont talk to people and why they dont talk to me。 i have never known how to talk to people and now i find i have no friends。,1
nothing makes me feel anything any more 。 i have tried so many things to feel happy or sad but i feel nothing any more 。,1
like i have been sad and lonely for so long that i dont feel any thing but some times i feel angry,1
i have no friends so i eat food instead and i watch movies 。 but it does not work any more 。,1

Suicide,1
"I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 17 years old, I’m now 30. It has been an ever increasing feeling that disrupts my thoughts. I grew up in what most would call a privileged life. A loving family who has always been there for me.",1
"I don’t have much to complain about. I have a stable job, a girlfriend who loves me, and recently bought my first home. Many people would be very happy in my situation. For some reason I don’t feel the same.",1
"I dread almost every day, dread responsibility, and wish I could sleep forever. Obligations to others feel overwhelming even when they ask very little of me. I can feel myself weighing on my close relationships. It’s only a matter of time before they cannot take it anymore. I know my girlfriend is not my therapist and I try to refrain from unloading my unhappiness onto her.",1
Most days I feel like the best thing for me to do is close off all ties to any person close to me in order to make the end less hurtful to them. I know they are all I have but it seems like life would be easiest by myself.,1
"I feel like my brain is broken to the point of not being able to fix it. I can’t imagine what happiness is, I only feel obligation to others to continue living. I would probably be dead if it wasn’t for my family and few close friends. The desire is quickly growing past the will to keep going.",1
It has become a daily task and it’s hurting me so much because I can feel it affect the ones around me. I don’t mean it to but the smallest things have started to set me off and probably make me unbearable to be around. I can’t shake the thought that the world would be better off without me.,1
"It would keep on turning and everyone would forget me in time. If I had a button that would erase my existence and memory then I would instantly push it, without hesitation or second thought. All I want is to sleep forever and cease to exist because existence is full of discomfort and pain.",1
is to be gone before Christmas. I keep praying that God will take my life quickly instead of making me continue he to suffer. So far no luck. Hopefully I get what I really want for Christmas.,1
Jan 20th. It will finally be a relief.,1
I am currently 19m and live in new zealand. This is a burner account.When i was between 12-14 i did some really unethical and illegal activities. I feel really guilty about it years later and I want to tell somebody. However im scared that doing so will put me in legal trouble and completely ruin my life. I have hopes to be a doctor in the future and if im charged with it i wont be able to practice (FACT). I realised what i was doing was very wrong and i truly wont ever do it again. I am currently already receiving treatment for anxiety and depression but I don’t know if I will ever get better without addressing what i did but if it jeopardises my future i dont know if anyone can find out. I have too much pride to give up on becoming a doctor to be something else so i can tell someone what happened. I was a high achiever in high school (I dropped out in year 13 because mental health) and i know i am fully capable of becoming a doctor. I just don’t know what to do i already live a shitty life because my living environment and have attempted suicide before. I dont want to throw away the small amount of hope for the future. Do i risk telling my therapist and be potentially reported or do i try figure it out myself?,1
(Sorry for shitty grammar and im not saying what i did),1
"Seriously, why did I have to born dirt fucking poor? With no hope for the future or a light at the end of the tunnel, being forced to live this hell.",1
"I just want to fucking end this, just exit this life I don't enjoy",1
"There’s a post on my page explaining the story and I don’t feel like telling it again, but I almost killed myself about an hour after my now ex ended the call where he broke up with me. I was cutting and self harming in other ways and I almost climbed over my balcony railing and threw myself off. It was so close. I was talked down by a friend but it’s still in me. I want him back. We talked again (I didn’t tell him) and he said that we might have a chance to try again in the future but we might not. I don’t know what to do holding onto that hope isn’t working.",1
"i just cant, im so sick to the head it's insane",1
"I've been battling my struggle of mental health for almost a month now. My homeroom teacher consulted me to the guidance counselor because she saw a scar on my hand and some fresh wounds, that I did since I hurted myself. I cut my wrist using a sharp glass that I destroyed—punched it and ended up bleeding a lot. I didn't regret doing it, since it releases relief in me.Then my cousin saw me doing it and called out my aunt, and she was very furious after seeing the blood on the floor—they didn't help me, and just watch me bleed. After that incident they treated me badly now. The whole fams perspective of me changed. They become very furious at me. I keep my distance to them. I tried my best to just hide my feelings as usual. Cried late at night and often times having an episodes of insomia. Yet still going to school acting like nothing happened. Hid the wounds in my hand by wearing a jacket or sweater. Laugh as if I am okay.",1
"The guidance counselor told me to consult to a professional, but my family couldn't afford it. So I just stayed quiet. Battling it all by myself.",1
"I am posting here because you all will probably understand my plight. I have decided that today is the day. My life is in shambles and I am so tired and embarrassed. Hiding from the landlord, no help anywhere, kids have lost their minds and live each day to make me miserable. I asked them to please just go and give me a few hours of peace before I depart. It feels good to sit here alone. I took something to calm me down. Now I am just trying to figure out the best route. I was prepared to slit my wrist as I have a high pain tolerance but after reading other posts, that doesn't always work. Anybody willing to give ideas? I am 46 yrs old so I am not a kid and have thought this out for a while. I don't have my PEW PEWS anymore because I had to pawn them. 2024 has been a doozy. Thanks for letting me rant.",1
"I stopped celebrating my birthday some years back because I thought the whole process was kinda annoying and always acknowledged it as a way companies get people to consume so I'm usually trying to practice anti capitalist things. I see a lot of people just be really excited about their birthdays but that's mostly when they have a social circle for that to matter. I've only really got my old friend and my girlfriend who I'm very thankful for. I love them both and hope they prosper in this difficult world. I didn't come here to say anything specific and I don't have any motives with this poet. I'm just not feeling well is all, oh yeah I turned 24 I almost forgot to mention. Hopefully people here get what they're looking for and live better lives filled with happiness, peace ✌️.",1
Nice. 69 days left until it comes. I need to stop counting and just let the day come.,1

"Long story short my whole lifes been shit, from start to the hopefully impending end. the last REAL light in my life said they are going to commit today and blocked me on everything, I can't check to make sure they're okay, and I can't stand this constant hell. I need some help getting over my fear of hell. Ever since I was young I was constantly hammered with the values of the Bible. The one that stuck out the most was of the sin of ending it on your own terms. I was taught that it was something that would have you sent to hell regardless of how kind, loving and charitable you are. I am still extremely afraid even though I'm not sure of its existence. Can someone help me please I want to go so badly I'm so tired of this constant wheel of torture I need to go now if I wasn't thinking of hell everyday I thought of ending it I would've been gone a long time ago so now I'm begging for an explanation or maybe some way I can go at no fault",1

Which clearly isn’t true, and can be called textbook irresponsible. Life is just challenging. I need to pick up myself, accept reality and get things done. I tried to do it for a while.

I’m alone, the only person I have to reach out to is part of the problem, and they just think I’m threatening it for control. I already attempted twice last month, went to the hospital once but got discharged the same day. Started therapy. It’s helping which is why I’m reaching out instead of planning now but it’s still really hard and I’m struggling.",1

"I (16M) don’t know what to do at this point. I’m stuck in a never ending loop and the only way I can think of solving the issue is very much not something that’d be ideal. I recently got diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) and borderline personality disorder (bpd), and it made me realize that the things I thought were just temporary problems that could get better quite literally cant. I’m forever doomed to have these two conditions fueling each other with no hope for ever changing.",1
"this is all without even mentioning that I already had 4 different diagnosis before these two that I was trying to learn to navigate. My whole purpose as a person is to connect with others, but I’m terrified that no matter what I do, every connection I try to have will slowly but surely crash and burn around me.",1
I don’t want to be like this for the rest of my life. I just want everything to stop. I don’t want the cycle to continue again & again like I know it will.,1
"I can go into more detail about the specifics if someone wants the full context, but I mostly just want to know if I can actually continue to exist and for it to be a good enough investment to yk, not kill myself to stop the cycle from continuing. (sorry if this sounds really bad, but this is the only way I can phrase this)",1
"I hate God for spoiling a useless person like me with opportunities and luxuries, meanwhile all the truly capable people are struggling to make it through life. I hate you so much. You're the worst. Now end my life please. Please, I'm begging.",1
"I’m so happy. I’ve finally found my solution. I need to die! The pain, it will all end. After a year of being beaten and raped only to have the courts tell me he doesn’t deserve any form of punishment is enough for me. Not to mention the 2 miscarriages and health insurance denying my life-saving medication! I make so little even though I have a doctorate degree. Every day is just a struggle to keep up with bills. Not anymore! Don’t need money or medication or law where I’m going. Hopefully somewhere peaceful. I don’t have fears anymore. My boyfriend, sisters, and parents won’t miss me. I’ve made peace with it all, and I’ve said my goodbyes. It will be as if I were never here. Goodbye, everyone! Promise to not mourn me!",1
its more harder to be positive nowadays,1
I can't fucking do this anymore. I've had enough of this fucking shit. I've fucking lost it. Why the fuck did God make me like this? Why the fuck did he do this to me? Is he sick? Am I just fucking evil? Why does he keep pushing me? I can't fucking stand this shit.,1
"I'm sick and fucking tired of these shitty intrusive thoughts, I'm sick of these illnesses, I'm sick of fucking school, I'm sick of being fucking harassed by weird ass faggots and by God.

"Hello everyone, I really need your opinion. So here I am, I have a virus in my eye that is almost undetectable on exams, I checked everything, I have been suffering from this damn inflammation for 15 months. This failing eye causes inflammation throughout my body and distorts my face. I have even consulted specialists who tell me that it is psychosomatic when it is completely false. So there you have it, I wanted to know if I would survive a 7.5 joule shot in my eye which would not reach my brain but which would completely destroy the eye to force ablation. Will I survive until help arrives? Give me your opinions please 🙏🤞",1
Edit: I have 100% informed myself of all the consequences. Namely the loss of consciousness after this impact due to the body's response. Relatively low risk of cardiac arrest. But I'm afraid my body won't handle extreme stress from just a hole in my eye for a few hours. There are people who have survived much worse but I don't know how that's possible.,1

"I’m a 14 year old female whose been diagnosed with autism, adhd, and general anxiety disorder. I’m terrified at the thought of dying at an earlier age than average due to my mutations, and it just plauges my mind. I’m contemplating wether or not I should just go to the train tracks at my dead end right now and wait to get hit. I’m never going to be as physically strong as everyone else and I’m just going to get bullied for it. I’ve had a history of bullying throughout middle school and I’m starting to think that they were right about me. They bullied me in a silent way, where it doesn’t appear as bullying, and more just acting like my friends but giggling non-stop and asking me random questions. They saw that I was socially awkard and physically weak and took advantage of me by trying to silently bully me. So many people did it to me to the point where the vice principal was only able to punish 1. It was like a hydra. Cut off one head and two more take its place. The next year in 8th grade, I tried telling the principal about all of it, but she thought I was just paranoid. I can tell she hated me due to the fact that she’d raise her voice at me while I was struggling to describe what I was going through. If I end my life right now, all those people would be happy and joyful that they succeeded. Maybe that’s what I can do to make more people happy I don’t even know at this point I’m just jumping from topics to topics and how I’m a pathetic bitch who won’t live a long life due to my autism. I sometimes wish my autism would just go away so I don’t have to deal with this pain. I feel at peace of the thought of death, while the thought of living scares me. I’m so intelligent, but at what cost? Poor motor skills? Poor socialization? Being treated like a pathetic child? Soon I’m going to be going outside near the train tracks at the end of the road to see if I should do it. Chances are I’ll be a pussy and decide not to and continue with a painful life.",1
"I’m 18 I just graduated high school I’ve got forever in front of me but I am so empty. I’ve been bullied my entire life by different people just because of who I am. I have never been at school without being afraid of others because they will always come find me. Even people I once called friends would ridicule me and make my life miserable. I can’t talk to people I don’t know, I can’t even hold conversations with people I do know. I’m terrified of talking to girls I might be interested in. I have friends who have just completely cut me off weeks after graduating. I have all these things I want to say to people but I can’t. I want to tell people about what I did today and what things I like but I have nobody who will listen. I want to tell someone how hollow and empty I feel all the time, I want to tell someone how badly I want to die and I want them to fix my problem. If I tell the friends I have left then it’ll just be a burden on them to think about me, or it’ll make our relationship awkward. I can’t tell my family because they’ll make a big deal about it like they did when I tried to kill myself a few years ago. What’s worse is I physically can’t say how I’m feeling. My mouth won’t let the words out, I always say I’m fine or I’m all good but I’m not and I haven’t been for a long time. I’m so terrified of everything, I don’t know why everyone is so awful to me, I don’t know why I’m such a pathetic and weak person. I don’t know why all my friends hate me. I don’t remember the last time someone said something nice about me. Not something nice about something I did, but something nice about me as a person. It’s because there is nothing good about me at all. I want to die so badly but at the same time I want to live so that I can see everyone’s reaction when I do kill myself, I want them to regret not inviting me to hang out and I want them to wish I was still alive. I feel so sick and I want it all to stop hurting so much. I’m going to kill myself soon if it doesn’t stop hurting so much. I’ll die by overdosing on paracetamol.",1
I spent a few days to be sure I want to go through with it and I’ve made up my mind that this is it. It’s what I must do 28m and I’m ready wish you all the best. Love to all.,1
"i was just in the bath and i know i've thought about killing my self but i didn't think i was going to go through with it, i tried to drown myself and i only realized when my lungs started to burn a bit that i didn't even think to leave a note. so yeah, im still here.",1
some days ive had upwards of 50 pills per day. why am i so unlucky? i started using Tylenol in high amounts 6 years ago.,1
"I 17f, am at the end of it all. I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was about 12. I have been through it all, seen both the sides of the public and private health system (Australia if that means something), searching in vein to find something that works, I’ve tried endless therapies, med combinations, clinicians but nothing seem to be helping. I am at my wits end. I just want the pain to stop.",1
I have been left with trauma that will never go away. My methods of coping are seemingly becoming more and more dull. My emotions are killing me.,1
"I currently live in an abusive household, With the prospect of becoming homeless within the next few months and no real way of making money.",1
I’ve spent the last month in hospital recovering from a failed attempt. A choice I do not regret making.,1
"And to be honest, the thoughts and choice to try again keeps creeping back in. And idk what to do about it. I don’t know what to do about any of it.",1
I don’t know what to do.,1
"I’ve been struggling for a little while now, I’m diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I want my life to end and I want to do it. But it’s just hard to make the leap.",1
I know I have people in my life that love and support me but I just can’t seem to believe it. I know that if I wasn’t here their life would be easier.,1
"I’m off work at the moment due to stress and that my coworkers hate me, and don’t care about me at all. I contribute nothing to this world and I think I would be better off gone.",1
"I’ve already been to the hospital this week but I can’t stop staring at this blade. I think I need help but I don’t want to go away. I don’t even know how to put what I feel into words, I am struggling so much right now.",1
"I don’t even know why I’m writing this or why I’m going to post it, I just hope I can cut deep enough this time",1
If only our parents had worn a condom smh.,1
This world is fucked and people that don’t have their life together have no right bringing kids to this world and passing on shit genes with no legacy,1
"I wake up, miserable in my mind, in my thoughts, in my actions and in my being. My parents dgaf about me whatsoever, I grew up neglected my entire life in all ways. I grew up with a fucked up foundation in all sorts. My mother is a narcissistic with GAD and depression and idk what which definitely affected me. I've had depression my entire life, I don't remember one day where I smiled from within and without. My depression makes everyone run away from me. Neither do I have friends nor family. I was told to shut up everytime I expressed and it made me believe that what I was going through was not painful enough or that it was normal and common and does not require attention. My mother gets very agressive, to the point where she breaks furniture, pulls my hair and gets physical with me. Though she stopped it rn, I started feeling anxious everytime a loud sound is made.",1
"It's been 3 years since the idea of killing myself appealed to me. I thought it was dumb to kill myself but with every growing second of the day, it makes sense. I can't live a life like this.. waking up, feeling like I'm paralysed and I need someone to take care of me. This year it has been the worse, it's pretty much the only thing on my mind tho.",1
"Idk how long i will make it, it surprises me that I did make it till here.",1
I feel trapped. I want to go but i cant leave people behind and they dont evwn know im worrying abt that and idk what to do,1
"I am useless at everything I do, or if I can do it I always mess it up in the end.",1
"I have no friends irl, and my socialising skills are unfathomably terrible. To a point where people avoid me because I am stupid or come off as creepy. The few friends I have online barely tolerate me since I get toxic when playing games with them, and when not playing I suck at talking. My family act like I don't exist since I just sit in my room all day every day. When I go to work I can never find the right way to interact with people, so I just end up doing as much as I can on my own.",1
"Just feel like I don't have a place in this world, and wouldn't mind just not existing anymore.",1
"One is loaded with just saline, the other is loaded with 50 mg of pure N-Nitrosodimethylamine. I forgot which one is which. I don’t wanna die but I don’t wanna live. Should I do it?",1
"For context, I’m a 20 year old male in the USA",1
"Idc about pain anymore. I have been struggling with bad thoughts ever since I started middle school. I damn near went school shooter a few years ago but the law stopped me before I bought the ar (I don’t have those thoughts anymore). Throughout my life, I have been plagued by adhd and lack of motivation which led me to failing out of college and me working a shitty blue collar job now. Since I’m stuck in this loop of eat sleep and work with pretty much no social life, should I take the slow way out and get cancer or should I just suffer this for another 50 years? Or should I just suck a 9mm and get it over with",1
"Hi everyone,",1
"I don’t know where else to turn, so I’m posting here in the hope that someone might understand what I’m going through. For years, I’ve felt like I’m being targeted—not in an obvious way, but in a way that affects every part of my life. It’s like someone has access to advanced technology, intervening in everything I try to do, and I can’t prove it or stop it.",1
"Every time I make a plan or try to achieve something, it feels like invisible forces are working against me. Whether it’s finances, relationships, or even small decisions, everything ends in frustration. It’s like someone is always one step ahead, ensuring that I fail.",1
"I have my suspicions about who might be behind this, but I have no proof. It feels like being completely monitored and controlled—every aspect of my life, from my devices to my personal choices, feels compromised. I can’t explain it logically, but it’s too consistent to ignore.",1
"What makes this worse is the isolation. When I try to explain this to others, they either don’t believe me or think I’m imagining things. But I know what I’ve experienced, and I know this isn’t just bad luck or paranoia.",1
"The worst part is that I’m starting to believe this force is far bigger than just me. It’s so powerful that I feel like I’m just a test subject—a guinea pig in a much larger experiment. And what’s terrifying is that I think this technology, whatever it is, might be released to the world one day, and it could affect everyone. I don’t know how, but I feel like I’m the first victim, and eventually, it could be used to control or destroy all of us.",1
"I’m exhausted. Living under this constant pressure, feeling like every move I make is being countered, has drained me emotionally, mentally, and financially. I don’t know how to break free or even how to confirm what’s happening to me.",1
Has anyone ever felt like this? Is there any way to investigate something like this or protect myself? Any advice or insights would mean a lot to me right now.,1
Thank you for reading.,1
I'd like to make her happy before I kill myself.,1
"So, this has been the worst year of my life. You know why? Ever since i decided to keep living, my life just kept getting worse. I just... Dont get how other people seem happy about this year. Sometimes, i just resort to drawing but i don't think it'll work. And plus, the bullies just won't even go away even until now. They don't understand how much it impacts my mental health, and plus, people always say ""YoU'rE gOiNg To HeLl If YoU dO tHaT!!1!"" Which makes me even worse. They also threatened me to get sent into a hospital. Also, i don't think i should live for long, let alone seeing my nephew grow. I just couldn't take it. From the threats, to the torture in my mind, its an endless cycle. (Sorry for bad grammar, english wasn't my first language, and I'm not really sure if guest posts are allowed)",1
I guess I'm just venting here. Idk why my brain has picked this day. Its been 2 weeks since I've started medication. Isn't that when it's supposed to start working? I'll give myself a little more time. I think I'm supposed to die young. I've never been able to imagine my future past 20.,1
"I was scared to turn 18 because I knew I had to have things figured by now and if I didn't then I'd be screwed. And here I am completely lost with no hope or capability to do something worthwhile. I've also just become incredibly sensitive, one ☝🏽 person downvoted my comment on how I was planning on volunteering but didn't think it'll help much and its ruined my mood. Maybe it's a bad idea to vent online opening myself up to strangers opinions that I can't handle . But I don't have anyone I can't talk to.",1
Do you die by starving yourself? Starving yourself to death is not painful,1
I believe in heaven and hell but what's gonna happen to me? Sometimes I don't even truly believe in it...am I gonna be reincarnated as an animal with all of my memories? Am I gonna be born again as a person? Hopefully with a better family.,1
"Am I gonna just go to sleep forever? Blessed with being able to live in an ""imaginative"" world that I can control and make up/change as I want for all eternity? (That'd be cool)",1
"Am I gonna be asleep forever not even existing at all? I can't even comprehend that..i wouldn't even see blackness/darkness because id be dead there wouldn't be anything to see at all. Would I possibly be able to just roam earth? Float, fly, go thru walls, teleport, speak to the living (a typical ghost, I'd be nice though...id be free)",1
"I'm so terrified and ready at the same time, but I'm not ready :( idk what's gonna happen.",1
"My friend committed suicide last year this time around. I don’t know if it is because this was the time when my friend took his own life or the things happening in my life rn, but I have been feeling super down lately. I thought I wouldn’t feel this way anymore since it has already been a year but sometimes when I’m going about my day I will just randomly think about it. I feel guilty, sad and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve had counseling sessions at my college but I don’t think it really helped. So my question is how do I get out of this slump and go on with my life. If you have gone through something like this, what were some ways you coped with grief?",1
TLDR: I lost my friend about a year ago to suicide. What are some ways I can cope with the grief?,1
"I have this close friend (17) the other day she showed me some stupid Reddit post she made and I thought it was funny so I went to see it for myself I guess she wasn't thinking because the other posts she made on there were concerning asf one talking ab how she wanted to kill herself and the other talking ab how much stuff she had taken and weather or not it would kill her, thank god it didn't and she went to the hospital and threw it all up or whatever. I had no idea things had gotten this bad I'm so scared idk what to do and who to tell?? I would tell her mum but I don't think she would understand and I'm scared she would send her overseas which would make the situation a million times worse.>!~~seeking advice~~!<",1
"I understand some of you guys are nonreligious but as a Muslim, religion is a big part of my life but unfortunately suicide is forbidden like it is in Christianity I presume. I feel like I’ve worked hard enough. It’s time for me to rest. I’m out of gas. You die a hero or live long enough to become a villain. I have been trying for years not to become a villain. If the only way to stop that is in death, then so be it. It’s ironic how in my pursuit of not becoming a villain, I would become the villain.",1
My stress is suddenly increasing and I can hardly stop myself from killing myself. I'm an attention seeker. I listen to music day and night and my sadness never goes away. I can't open up to anyone.,1

"im 23M. i feel my life is over before it has even begun. i still live with my dad. I just abruptly quit a decent and accomodating job I've had for 3 months, because.... I don't know . one day I wake up and it is like every fiber of my being is telling me not to go, I can't do it, even if i soldier through and go the feelings just get stronger, even when I have a fairly relaxed schedule only working 4 days a week... This past year I have had like 4 different jobs that I end up staying at for a very short time before dramatically leaving after a short time. I am broken. If i can't even muster up the willpower to stay at these piss-easy entry level jobs, then what am I doing here?  I have essentially ""quiet quit"" life. I laid down to die, like a sick animal, just kind of hoping that I will randomly get hit by a truck or have a brain rupture or something that will just end me. But that hasn't happened yet, so I'm kinda stuck in limbo. things are piling up. I haven't filed my taxes in 5 years. I haven't seen a dentist in 6. ive only been to the doctor once in 3 years. I'm making very poor financial decisions because I am not thinking about my future, like it won't even exist. Im in the middle of paying off 1k of credit card debt, $700 balance left over from my car getting repossessed, and I just financed a gaming computer with Progressive Leasing, which is basically predatory payday loans for people with no/low credit scores...",1
"I am thinking about death a lot more recently. I feel like I don't fit in to this society. the thought of having a job to go to every day makes me want to kill myself.. I dont have plans to kill myself anytime soon, but if i dont then I still have so many things to fix and no idea where to even start. and now I just self-sabotaged by quitting a job, and now to start the entry-level job hunt cycle again... it's fucking exhausting. I am so tired. I am drowning. I do not want to live this life. all i've been doing is numbing my emotions and bottling everything up. im so lonely. I dont have many people to talk to, and I have been afraid to talk about the full depths of my despair with any friends or family. it would be a sweet release to be able to even say all this stuff to another human and have them listen and hear me. i need professional help, but my phone anxiety and executive dysfunction make it hard to do... anything, really.  thanks for listening",1
"This morning I got really hopeless and angry with myself and I opened the window and climbed up so I can jump. I got scared, but not too much, climbed back down and sat on my bed.

"This is a burner account btw, So I'm an 18 year old dude in a college in a third world country that got his laptop stolen twice, I'm very aware I sound spoilt and it's pretty trivial compared to some of the shit I see others facing in this sub but my entire family hates me now because they blame me for being careless. I'm never going to be able to afford another laptop by myself (it was a gaming one and my dad isn't gonna get another) and continue to do the stuff I love so I would rather someone on this sub gave me ideas for a peaceful exit than continue with this constant dull pain.",1
i hate having depression. i dont want to be lazy anymore. i dont want to skip school anymore. i dont want to skip meals anymore. i just want to be normal. why did i have to have depression. i dont want to be alive in a world where i cant live normally. i hate having to genuinely fight myself just to go to school or to shower or to not kill myself. i hate it all. i dont care if it hurts when i die anymore nothing can hurt more than being on this earth.,1
I'm gonna jump out my apartment window so yeah! I might post a video of me doing it but oh yeah. Am on floor 11 so I uh yeah. Just chilling on the window waiting and watching for a couple minutes before I go down. I've tried attempting from the 3rd floor once. Didn't work. Now am on the 11th. My life in general was super shifty. I deserve to be taunted. Bullied. Humiliated. And am glad people are understanding I suck.,1
Hello :3,1
I know this may seem small to other people who may be reading it but it's a big deal to me.,1
As a Filipino lady who grew up the Asian way (yes stereotypes are real). I feel pressured to pass my student visa interview to the States even when I don't want to go the US (I want to go to the UK).,1
It's my third time to be rejected and the stress is just building up everyday. Now the thing thats pulling me back to depression is that my family seems to be so bipolar about everything.,1
"Just a few days ago my mom was chill and joking about ""If I don't pass, that's alright because we get to spend Christmas together"". Happy happy and all... but then just today she turns and says ""Your just like your sister"".",1
"Now context about my sister, she is in her third try on three subjects she has failed (and has failed again). She was suppose to graduate this year around Spring, but because she kept failing these three subjects she couldn't proceed and finish (also she didn't choose this course. My parents pressured her to just apply to this university she doesn't even want to go to and just apply, to which she regrets up to today).",1
My sister has been really depressed recently as well because she really wanted to go back to the Philippines and just do her bachelors there. Since it was the pandemic she couldnt and my parents told her to just find a school here where we were. Now she is regretting it because it is hard to find part-time jobs here and earning money by ourselves is rather rare without connections. (at this point I'm just living to see the day my sister is happy... I am living to see both my sisters happy).,1
I wanted to go to the UK as well since I was in high school but never opened it up to my family up until today. My opinion is usually kept by myself so I have a hard time expressing myself as well.,1
There is so much context I want to share about myself here but in the best summary I could put it...,1
"I want to, you know what it is. I've been placing cat marks on my wrists since I was in highschool (ever since my dad has been cheating on my mom... and my mom being bipolar with everything... and idk at this point I probably have bipolar from this and my dad too... whatever). I switched my religion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it seems to help me from going back the dark path but... my family is not helping at all.",1
"When they knew about my frequent marks they just shrugged it off saying ""Ok, if you want to die go jump the building or something you dumb child"" in tagalog ofcourse (""Cge, magpakamatay ka naman pala tumalon ka na lang binuang kang bayhana ka""). Very demure XD.",1
"I won't though so don't call anyone for me... I think I'll live till I see my parents 6 feet under... or something... but I have been well... planning my sudden det slowly and naturally (eating too much sweets, staying up late, and such)... At least I want to di normally I guess.",1
Sorry if this was somewhat depressing XD I didn't mean to... I just needed somewhere to vent I guess... There is more to this life I have but this is the most I can share...,1
"I hope those people with the same or worse scenarios find peace... I really just want all of us to find happiness (I don't want to say anything bs like ""God gave us life"" or ""Satan is the key"" or some shyt because in the end, we get to decide what's up for our lives). Just think how would things be if you were suddenly able to do things you would love to do or how would you live when your parents are 6 feet deep or probably even alive but you became stable because of the pressure placed on you?",1
"You can always be selfish for once and think of a bright future. Like if you end it now, do you think you can go and do things the child you would love to do?",1
At least bandage the scars placed upon you when you were a child (or an adult or whatever) just make sure that you remember that everyone WILL judge you no matter what you do.,1
At this point just do whatever makes you happy (Ofcourse without harming anyone).,1
Thaz all for now at least hehe :3 Goodluck with life eveyone\~,1
I feel so lonely,1
My partner and i have had numerous fights,1
They don't really understand when i ask for emotional support and needs even though i say exactly what it is i need,1
Things just feel wrong after the last big fight even thought things are patched up,1
I feel like its me that's the issue,1
Im so depressed,1
This feels like another tell tale sign that im too dysfunctional to be in a relationship or in society,1
Im just hurting a lot and have no one to talk to,1
"So I have been posting on Reddit for a long time, countless subreddits, posts and everything else...",1
"I am getting older, grayer, dumber, sicker and more hopeless.",1
The more time passes I feel like I should have done it a long time ago.,1
"I came from a not so healthy childhood it is a long story, I don't have the energy of talking about again and again.",1
"I have dyscalculia, dyspraxia, ADD, dermatitis, kyphoscoliosis, sleep problems, depression, occasional tension headaches where I want to vomit and I have digestive issues because I have IBS. I also have brain fog and I am just constantly tired.",1
My work schedule is as follows:,1
Early Shifts (8:30 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.),1
Wake-Up Time: Early morning to ensure you're ready for work.,1
"Commute: A 30-minute journey via public transportation, as it's more available during the day.",1
"Work Hours: I spend the day at work, finishing at 6:00 p.m.",1
"Evening: After the commute back home, I have some time to unwind and prepare for the next day.",1
Night Shifts (ending at 3:00 a.m.),1
Work Hours: I work through the evening and into the night.,1
"Commute: After my shift ends, it takes about an hour to get home due to reduced public transportation availability at night.",1
"Post-Shift Routine: I typically need another hour to relax and transition to sleep, meaning I fall asleep around 5:00 a.m.",1
"I have two days off usually after two nights, and then I do two early shifts and after that two nights...",1
"It is tough on me, I recently made a mistake at my work and I got so mad as I already wasted so much money, 100 euros is much for me, I have to work whole day with people I despise for that money...",1
I don't want to go to a psychiatrist or psychologist because I don't see any legit way that they can help expect offer coping through pills and CBT gaslighting.,1
What else is there?,1
I know that title is kinda weird and cryptic so I'll try and better explain myself now.,1
"Im 16M I've suffered with severe depression, autism, and symptoms of BPD. I've tried taking my own life before, I self harm alot which makes me need to wear long sleeve coats even in college, just overall I suffer alot with overthinking and self abuse with destructive tendencies.",1
This is gonna be abit of a vent/tangent but I'll try my best to make how I feel clear.,1
"Basically, I've realised that due to my past and experiences, I only find attraction in girls that fit into a certain type. That type being, girls that suffer mentally like me and suffer with isolation just like me.",1
"I don't ever even try and find attraction in girls that are confident and social or are really pretty and beutiful. I see girls like that and I don't feel anything, I don't see them in a bad way cause of these things but I don't see them romantically.",1
"Girls that are average or below average and that suffer alot with isolation and mental issues are who I find attractive. And I find them attractive because that's who I am, I see myself as ugly and I've suffered with isolation alot so i find comfort with people who've gone through the same things.",1
"It also could be self esteem issues, im not entirely sure on that. Its not like I can't talk and be friends with girls that are confident or social or really pretty. Infact I get along with them pretty easily, It's just, I'll never see them in a romantic way.",1
"And there's another reason why I've developed this kind of type, especially at a young age (being 16) which is that, my first ever serious relationship was with a girl that suffered with schizophrenia, depression and isolation.",1
"I really loved her and found her incredibly attractive, far more than any other women while I was with her. And now, I realise that because of my ex, I value relationships with females that I can relate too. And I relate to people through their suffering and bad past experiences with things like isolation.",1
"Maybe, maybe I find beuty in the socially dismissed, having kinda been one myself.",1
"And this scares me, it scares me alot cause thinking about it and seeing how it effects my life, it makes me have to confront who I am and my own problems.",1
"It's also led to a really hard situation for me. Right now I'm good friends with a girl who I kinda like romantically and who I think likes me too. So you may wonder, what's the issue?",1
"Well, I know this is gonna sound really weird and shallow but...she's too pretty. Like genuinely, I think she's socially above average, she's really cute and beutiful overall. And, thats holding me back alittle from attempting to be something more with her.",1
"It goes against my own self worth by seeing her in that way, it goes against what I value and I feel like I'm just stuck, like I'm in a really difficult place. On one hand, I really like her and think she's funny and nice, on the other hand, it goes out of my comfort zone. A comfort zone that's been built up through years of depression, isolation, and my first ever relationship which was with someone that I loved who was not attractive conventionally and suffered mentally but who I found the most beutiful person in the whole world during our time together.",1
"This is just a massive ramble, it's been in my head alot recently. There's so much I struggle with and this is just one slice of the massive complicated pie that is my life.",1
"Am I a bad person for finding attraction to girls who are like me? That suffer mentally, that have struggled with isolation, that are desperate for love and affection and have felt like they've never received it.",1
"It's not like I wanna try and say that this ""type"" of women is healthy, I know it isn't. I never would try and tell others to only go for potential partners who are suffering. Its not a good thing and it's certainly not healthy, I'm aware of that. This is just my own unconscious type, that ive developed cause of all the things I've mentioned in my big dumb vent.",1
"And, a huge part of me just wants to, end it all. I wanna just, drift into a deep lucid dream and never wake up.",1
"That'd be perfect, and I know someday I will pass away and I will accept death with open arms. But I also know letting death take me early isn't what's best for me, even though I want it bad.",1
I dunno. I'm sorry for the rant.,1
just lost my job i think this is my last straw i just cant anymore. i just cant fucking do this. im aimlessly walking around town i dont think ill go home,1
I woke up with the most awful dream about my ex.,1
"I was sitting in a car while my dad was driving me to the dentist, and my ex's brother sat next to me to talk about how much my ex regrets falling in love with me. That I was just merely a mistake in his life and how I should never talk to him again.",1
"Then I snooped through my ex's phone and saw pictures of him with a new girl whose blonde, pretty, has blue eyes, wiith the most gut-wrenching photos of them together in a car with the sun going downand smiling. Then there's photos of her meeting his family and smiling with her with their approval as if she is already welcomed. (His family always hated me and called me crazy from being in a mental hospital)",1
"None of this shit is even fucking real but it hurts so bad despite being merely a fabrication of my own mind. It's made me genuinely suicidal and overwhelmed at the idea of my ex being with someone else and treating her better than me. (He was abusive towards me in the beginning but we were toxic to eachother as well and I wanted to fix it) Maybe I deserve this, maybe I don't get to be happy.",1
Just quit my 3rd job on 6 months. I want to kms but I can't because I don't really have any means to. I live with my parents and they're always keeping a watch on me even though they don't really care about my mental health. I just want the pain to end.,1
"I died 2 years ago, I'm unrecognizable, my brain works on extreme slow levels, I've lost all functioning of self, I haven't showered or brushed or helped anyone for months, I've damaged my healthy family. I can't seem to kill myself even after multiple stupid attempts. I should die for the good of my family and the community and I know this, I'm trying to go to the beach to drown, I'm postponing it alot. I should really do it for my family so they get back to normal and live happy",1
"I tried overdosing on meds a couple years ago but it was just a cry for help and it makes me feel weaker than I already am. I don’t have any motivation, or discipline or dedication to anything. I feel like I have nothing to really live for. Everytime something triggers me lately I think about suicide or self harming. But thats probably because I feel like nobody cares about me. I hate dealing with social anxiety, just even the slightest feeling of being rejected makes me cry. I only have one friend and shes shitty to talk to and doesn’t stand up for me at all.

"One word to describe me perfect is disposable. I'll never be good enough for anyone, and if I am, it will only be temporary until I'm ghosted or stabbed in the back. I honestly don't understand why I even try anymore. I should just give up and end it all. Nobody will ever love me, and if they claim to, their just lying to try and make me feel appreciated. I have no good friends that ever check on me and see how I'm doing, I have two ""amazing"" parents, one that will never say a word to me unless he needs something, and the other one lying to me on a daily basis. All I ever want is to feel appreciated by someone or something, but that's too much to ask for. I'll just face the facts, I'm no good, and will never be any good. I'm a failure at everything I do, a failure to my parents, and a complete waste of life. I wish there was something I could do to change things but this is just the way it is, and the way it will always be. If nobody talks to me or acknowledges me I must not be seen, therefore I dont exist. If I dont exist, then why am I so called living. I guess Ill just end it all, its not like anybody would notice.",1

# Why do I have to keep living if I didn't ask to be born in the first place?,1
I don’t know anymore .. I’m so tired of living anymore … sometimes I just want to toss in the towel and give up …,1
I got into a car accident a while ago and didn’t have insurance . Thought my insurance just laspe but didn’t know it was canceled a week before . I was headed to a doctor appointment and it was raining and the roads were wet . And I was having to drive down this s curve road . And my tires slipped and I lost control and I ended up getting hit then I hit someone else . Lucky we all were alive … but I decide to do the right thing and stay while the other driver left . I explained everything to the officer and he was cool . But I took the fault cause I didn’t have no insurance . And cause the 3rd driver left before . So I figured it was used less … then I got help paying the ticket to advoid the summons cause I didn’t even know if I could make it to it .,1
Then get a letter stating I had to pay a reinstatement fee and get a sr22 which I did and I also got my insurance back the same day . Without knowing that it was cancel and didn’t know it didn’t take effect til the next day . Now I’m up in bills cause I gotta pay for the damages which is fine but now I get a letter about an indefinite license suspension . Unless I show proof I had insurance at the date and time of the accident . Which I can’t even do …. And I even have a job and am working on paying for the damages . But I don’t know anymore … I’m just so fed up and I know etc . I’m almost to the point of telling them that they can just have my license’s and come home and tie a noose around my neck and jumping .,1
Sorry I just got home a couple of hours ago from work … i wonder if they can sue the dead,1

"I have a degree in Accounting and graduated in 2022, since then I have been struggling to get a job. It’s not like I’m not applying because I am and have applied to probably over a 1,000 at this point. The longer I am unemployed the more employers are put off because of the gap in employment, an endless vicious cycle. I have also been going through domestic abuse and that has affected me in so many ways. I had a temporary job for 5 months and I lost all the money trading. With trading, because of my mental health and home life being unstable I have an unhealthy addiction of trading my money hoping that I can make some money to flee my home life but I keep losing it. Without a job I can barely save and I feel like I’m never going to be able to get out of this rut. My mum also made me homeless last winter and she is doing the same now, she owes me £10,000 and keeps getting the police to kick me out because she won’t put me on the tenancy agreement and she doesn’t want to pay me back. The police are useless they don’t do anything, my mum dances around and makes fun of suicide and she has been forcing me to end my life. My brother is dangerous and is known to the police for selling drugs and my mum uses him to threaten me. I don’t know how to get out of this situation. Last winter she forced me to sleep in the snow. She also makes comments like suicidal people are selfish idiots. I can’t live peacefully and I can’t seem to leave. My mum doesn’t even care about my brother either but she is his “favourite” child because of the money he makes from drugs, he gives her a few hundred in cash like every week but when I ask her to pay me back so I can move out she calls the police or she will say how dare I ask an old women for money or that she has no money and she is the one suffering. She has done this to us all and she is the reason we grew up in foster care. She almost starved us to death as young children and didn’t even take us to school everyday because “she couldn’t be bothered”. She’s called the police on literally everyone in our family and no one wants anything to do with her and my brother. Because I am stuck with them, I can feel so much hatred and bullying everyday. I also didn’t grow up in this city so I don’t have anyone I can turn to when she kicks me out. I don’t want to go to homeless shelter because I have been homeless before and that triggers my suicidal thoughts. Whenever she can’t get her own way she will call the police and make some horrible stories like one time she convinced them I was trying to kill her when I wasn’t even in the same room. I used to always protect my brother when I was younger but I honestly hate him now. He knows what she’s like, she’s even tried to kill him before, yet he doesn’t help me. He only convinces her more to become violent. I’m guessing because of being a drug dealer he doesn’t want anyone around who will hurt his “mums good boy” image. I wouldn’t say I’m a bitter person despite everything but now I do honestly hate my mum and brother and wish suffering on them. I don’t care anymore.",1
"19f was homeless when I was 17 and lived in a dv refuge for a while, no family at all. Finally moved into another temporary place but I have no heating so I'm pretty cold, and I can't stop crying. I just lost my only 2 friends after a heated argument, no matter how much anyone tries they're never good enough and don't care like a family member would and I get mad. I think I'm a terrible person. I can't form any sort of relationship whatsoever because of everything I went through. I tried counselling for a year but it never worked and I'm not ready to talk about everything that happened. If I died I'd have nobody to attend my funeral I'm just taking up space in another temporary accommodation. I can't stop crying I wish I wasn't like this.

I 20 M feel like everyone hates me. I’ve failed out college. Ever since I was probably 11 I’ve felt depressed and anxious but I’ve always gotten by in school and life. But these past few years I’ve been more lost than ever. I’ve made nothing but mistakes. I chose college major on a whim in hopes of making money and not for passion. I’ve now failed a bunch of classes and are going to be a year late from my graduation year. My parents are disappointed. My older sister is doing well in school which I’m happy for her. She’s been through a lot more than me and deserves a better brother than me. I’ve got a mental block and I can’t fix it. I reached out to my doctor for psychiatrists and they given me a list and I just need to call. I’ve still haven’t called. It’s been a week and I can’t do it. Each day I get closer to finally ending it. I don’t know if I can go any longer I’ve found the subreddit and I thought this was gonna be my call for help but I think this might my push to the edge. I don’t know how I’m gonna do it. I’m not old enough to get a gun and I’m too scared to bang myself. I might go to a beach and let the waves take me.,1

She doesn't deserve to have to deal with the grief of my passing, and all of her effort and care going to waste.

Then there's the whole deal of me being pitied or my mental agony being widely misinterpreted, and all the false sympathies and fake caring — blegh! I don't want any of it.

All of that sounds absolutely daunting — can I just fucking get on with it? I was in the hospital recently for a collapsed lung, and that was such an awful experience. So painful.

She's been trying to attack me lately, and I can hardly recognize her. It's really odd how you can go from infinitely close to incredible hostility towards each other in such a short period of time.

I'm quite confident in my defense, but the idea of fighting her in court with a bunch of lawyers just sucks considering how close we used to be.

Each time I went through our messages, I just felt knives being twisted in my chest, one by one. No joke — that was one of my physical symptoms. I just wanted to close this chapter and forget about it. I don't want to access that kind of pain again. I hate being reminded of how mentally ill and self-destructive I was, and how things were between us before this situation happened.",1

Was it being abandoned, abused, and neglected as a child? Was it being beaten? Was it my BPD? Was it self-destructiveness due to a fear of happiness? Was it my fear of intimacy?

"I have the Irish Indoor Rowing Championships on January 18th but I am so scared the coaches will let me go, not want me, think I’m useless since I didn’t compete today… Will they be angry I didn’t reply?",1
"January 18th is so far away, is it too late?",1
"I feel like I want to talk to someone and just let it all out. I want to tell the coaches what’s been going on, why I’m 30lbs lighter, haven’t contacted them, can’t compete today. But I don’t know. I’m so anxious all the time. I want it to end. I want this anxiety to end. I feel like I have hope somewhere that things will work out, I tell the coaches about what’s going on, how I can’t compete in the British championships due to my weight loss and disorder. Tell them I have a month for the Irish Championships and I can give everything they want, tell them I’m worth it. Hope in the fact that I have a gap year lined up so they can understand that because my signing to their college would be in July, and there’s the World Championships, National Junior Championships, Irish Championships and Hartpury Competition between now and then for me to show them I AM worth it. Hope that they email back even after not going to the British Championships, hope in this.",1
"I do have hope in this. But how would I even phrase my emails, my calls. This anxiety eats at me, I’m sat here and I want to just book the train ticket, write my letters, say my goodbyes, pick my song, and be free.",1
"I don’t reply to my friends, I don’t text them back. My friends birthday party is meant to be today, but I can’t I feel so stressed. Do I cancel last minute and ducking disappoint her, or stick it out. I have my Cambridge interview on Monday, but I’m so fucking scared for it, am I even good enough? I have my history coursework due on Monday too, and I need to do 99% of it. I don’t know, I don’t know!",1
"I’m so anxious, nervous, depressed, nauseous all the time. ALL the time. I feel so weak, like I’m not good at anything at all. I feel like I waste everything I get, like nobody will ever want me. And worrying I push everyone away, even if they like me, I push them. For no fucking reason.",1
"I don’t know, I really don’t. I feel so lost, so anxious. I want peace- end. I want to book tickets to the place, and I want to feel end.",1
"I noticed the greatest number one reason people die is from loneliness and lack of support and abandonment in all walks of life. I was wondering as many struggle with it a lot, and those who truly spiral if they’ve been exposed to it much longer, why does it make anyone go crazy and spiral into absolute madness? It’s such a heartbreaking feeling because those with BDD, BPD, and schizophrenia deal with the trauma of it more but anyone realistically can if they have lost all connection to love, compassion, and respect that it makes us loses our sense of self and belonging especially after it was taken from those who never had a chance at life and was placed into danger their whole lives. This could equally be the same if you suffer from depression or suicidal thoughts. You just loose yourself and you then become driven with madness",1
Please excuse formatting as I'm posting from mobile.,1
So I told my therapist that I've been experiencing worsening suicidal ideation over at least the past several weeks. Why didn't I tell her sooner?,1
"1. I don't want to admit it's happening. If I do, then it's real and I have to deal with it.",1
2. I feel ashamed and like I am letting her down because I'm getting worse but I'm doing this shit to myself,1
"Anyway, I have been using cannabis at an increasing rate over the past few months and it has started to become a concerning situation. I also don't want to admit this, and feel ashamed of it as well... like I can't have a damn ounce of self control to just lay off the weed for a little bit?",1
My psychiatrist and my therapist both think I need to prioritize getting off the weed and yet here I am still using.,1
Also can someone tell me how transference works and why I feel the way I feel about my therapist? Thanks for reading.,1
"I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. People see me weird. I have never be able to fit in. I think everyone secretly hates me. I think I don't deserve to be loved. I am a monster. I have been called to end it all. My friends have supported me. But more than appreciate it, I hate the fact that I made them go through such a horrific phase of mine, and the suicidal thoughts grow more and more. They don't deserve that. I'm feeling very frustrated because all my attempts have failed. I want to do it right now. But I don't know how. I tried hanging myself. I'm too scared to do it.",1
"idk im tired. of feeling like this. like i don’t belong, like im a struggle to deal with, like im literally useless and a waste of space on this earth. been having homicidal urges, and they’re telling me to give in. i found an mini axe on the back porch. im gonna use it to split my head open or slit my wrist. or i will just run away and call 911 and hope that i can get the police to shoot me. afraid i might end up trying to use the axe on someone before taking myself out. been considering getting parents to drive me to ER cuz i feel im dangerous rn, but i don’t wanna worry anyone nor prolong living",1
I’m currently embarrassed and anxious . I was regretfulling playing around in the hotline saying I’m gonna kill myself by taking pills. 20 mins later I get phone calls and police knocking at my door at 11:30 pm.,1
"I was in incognito and gave no name at all, fake age. Yet they knew exactly who I was. Absolutely no history with anything similar before. I’m shooken up right now. Cringed out of my mind I made police come waste there time on a stupid joke. They were asking questions like I was a mentally ill suicidal.",1
"that happened some time ago, but I think about it sometimes. it was said in a jokingly manner, but I think he meant it. and instead of being concerned or sad, I felt angry and hurt.",1
"I couldn't help but think ""seriously? this? this is what keeps you alive?"". it felt unfair, because for me, HE was one of the reasons I hadn't killed myself yet. though I do have my own ""silly"" reasons as well.",1
"I know I shouldn't blame him. I should be happy he's here, right? but maybe if he wasn't, then I wouldn't either.",1
but maybe I'm too fucked up to try to think about this rationally.,1
"I've been planning this for over a year. It's my birthday. I'm only allowed to kill myself on my birthday. I'm having doubts, but I can't bear the thought of spending the rest of my life trying to recover from something that either no one knows about or no one took seriously.",1
"When I first started feeling this way, last year, I did reach out to people. I did what I thought was all the right things. I told so many people. Multiple people from work, family, friends. I even told one person about the ""only on my birthday"" thing. I guess no one cares. No one takes me seriously. If I don't kill myself tonight, I won't even be able to blame them.",1
"Nothing is going right so far. I need to drop my kids off with my grandma. I waited until today to buy the things I need for Plan A, and multiple stores were out. And my kids are trying so hard to make today special. I love them. They'll be better without me. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of all the voices in my head. All the awful, terrible thoughts that I have to fight against every single day.",1
I'm so tired. It's not that I want to die. I just don't want to live. I've let everything go. Every credit card is maxed out. My teeth are in terrible shape. I have gum disease now. I've lost so much weight. I can't not do it. Every decision I've made over the past year was made knowing I would be dead soon.,1
"Everything is set up as well as it can be. It's amazing how well everything fell into place. It's just tonight that's not going right. But I have a Plan B, C, D... It's just time, now. I waited too long to get started. I have to finish setting up. I should have dropped the girls off hours ago.",1
"I'm so sad for them. But they'll be better without me. Some people make a positive change by being alive. I'm going to do it by being dead. My whole life, I've just been a lesson for other people. A test. How many times have I been called a test. I'll die and people will learn from it and grow. It's all I'm here for. But I'm tired. And I think I allowed to die now. It's been all I've wanted since I was 11. I just feel so bad for my kids.",1
"I guess I want at least some people to know that I tried. I feel like I've been a poster child...a walking cliche of what someone about to kill themselves looks like. It feels like it's been leaking out of me. No one noticed. No one cared. But I did try. I was even in therapy. Well, counseling, if there's a difference. When I ghosted her, she didn't even try to figure out of I was okay. But I tried that, too. I tried.",1
I'm scared. I'm tired. I'm taking them now.,1
"I’m so tired of all of this, im tired of being the safety net or the second choice. I’m tired of being the backup friend or the tutor.",1
"I thought I was getting better, I really did but that was just a fucking joke. I want to end it. I’m always one step behind in everything, in school, at home, in my social life.",1
"I really want to die, I need to do something. What’s the point of going on when I have no one and nothing going for me.",1
"I want to be someone’s best friend or someone’s crush, I want to be loved and not because im the only option left.",1
Honest question: what’s a painless way to die?,1
I was at the sucide hotline on my laptop incognito mode. I was pretending to the person on the end of the line that I was wanting to kill myself and take pills. Sorta trolling and bored but also just interested on what they say. I was getting bored and the end the chat I said to the lady that took all the pills and thanks.,1
30 mins later I get a call from a random number and I search it up and it’s a police station number but I thought it was a scam. I get another call and voice mail from the police department. I start freaking out because how did they get my info.,1
1 minute after the call I get heavy knock on the doors to open up. They said my name and exactly what I talked about the hotline.,1
I was scared shit less and embarrassed because I was on the hotline out of boredom. How the hell did they get my info on incognito? I gave no names,1
"I feel like the world is just so wrong. Everything feels so off.....like I’m stuck in some strange, alien place where nothing makes sense. It’s painful, physically and mentally.",1
I don’t know if anyone else feels this way but living in reality just feels like hell.,1
"I’m wondering if to get through life, people need to live in complete delusion, to convince themselves of things that aren’t true, just to survive. When I see the world for what it is, it feels like nothing makes sense, and I can’t find peace.  I wish i didn't feel so alone. I don't fit in anywhere. I don't want to live in my skin",1
"Life in society feels so unnatural , i feel so disconnected from everything , even conversations with people seem so empty. It’s like no one is really listening—they just talk to themselves. Nobody cares.",1
Cold and cruel.,1
"I don’t know why I’m so aware of all this, and honestly, I don’t want to be.",1
Am I having an episode? Or is this just reality? I just want to wake up from this nightmare. Does anyone else feel this way?,1
They know for sure that I’d never try to kms. That I’m too much of a weak pussy that doesn’t even know how to fight for that.,1
They’d love to just erase me and start over. A new me. A new child. A new friend. A new nephew.,1
"Look at you dangling alone. So lonely. Heartbreaking scene if it wasn’t you. But you deserve everything you live. You destroyed and wasted the life of your mother. Your father left you for good and chose his daughter. Uncles and cousins are disgusted by you. Friends don’t call you, matter of fact they’re not really your friends, you know they hate you. You hurt so many people. Grandparents are disgusted for what you are, your hair, your nose, your face, your grades, you missing school. No one likes you. Not even yourself.",1
No one’d choose you.,1
I should end it. End this miserable life. This meaningless pathetic existence. They pity you. Look at you with disgust. You deserve everything. It was supposed to be this way the day I was born and abandoned by my father. The day I chose to get out of my mothers womb that day. The day my mother chose to keep me even when she was pressured to abort. The day my mother chose to reveal she was pregnant of me. The day she met my dad. The day I saw my mother being strangled by my dad. The day I was sequestrated in my room for years. The day I chose to not speak until I’m spoken to. The day I was bullied. The day my cousins started to bully me. The day my uncles viewed me as a waste of air. The day my dad cheated on my mother. The day I found her crying. The day I learned she tried to off herself. The day that teacher screamed at me. The day that principal accused me of lying about my whole class bullying me. The day I’ve been beaten in a fight. The day I chose to watch porn. The day I cut ties with the only people who I mattered to them. The day I met that girl who played with me like I was a useless insignificant toy. The day my mother abused and told me she wished she didn’t get me. The day my father abused insulted me in every way I know. And The day I knew I’d kill my self one day. All of that was when I was 13… I am 17.,1

"Hi guys a bit about me.i am a young adult and a girl.i am a lifelong sufferer of suicidal ideation and have many many attempts in my life in the past.I have achieved some stuff nobody ever thought was possible and I'm pretty and skinny now.the punchline is that here I am.xmas is a very hard time for me with grief.my grandpa who raised me died in 2021, my best friend of ten years ghosted me in 2022, and who I now fear is the loml dumped me ten years ago nearly.some stuff happened this year that reminded me of him and I reached out to him for advice but he ghosted me as well.i just want to be free now let everyone move on.I feel like this world is not good enough for me and I live in a state od misery and disgust.i don't produce enough, I don't have my own kids or anything basic.and now all the love and excitement is gone from my life.i am into tarot cards and I asked the people on the tarot subreddit to interpret my cards but I didn't tell them that I had ascribed 'move on' to suicide and the person told me effectively my cards said suicide is the answer.I can't tell you what relief and hope that brings me that I won't have to suffer anymore but im scared to leave anyone in grief like I feel.I only hope i find the balls to do it soon and I'm smart enough to dispose of myself in a way im not found.",1
